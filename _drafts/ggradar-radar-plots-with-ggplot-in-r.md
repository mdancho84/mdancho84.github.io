Let's face it. These days, everything is built off of comparisons. In business, we compare customers, products, service providers, hotel chains, doctors offices, revenue by verticals...

**Every dataset has groups. And group-wise comparisons can be tricky.**  Thankfully an R package exists to help us compare within groups using a visualization called a **Radar Plot.**

**What R package is it?** It's called `ggradar`. And I want to share it with you so you can do business comparisons (like customers with RFM Analysis) in under 10-minutes. Here's what you learn in this R-Tip:

1. **How to use Radar Plots in Business (Customer Segments, Avatars, & RFM Analysis)**
2. How to make Radar plots with `ggradar`
3. **BONUS: How to sort the radar plots using similarity (important for identifying similar customers and products)**

# What Do I Make In This R-Tip?

By the end of this R-Tip, you'll make this **radar plot comparing multiple products.** Perfect for impressing your boss and coworkers! (Nice Plotting skills)

# Thank You Developers.

Before we dive into `ggradar`, I want to take a moment to thank the data scientist and developer of ggradar, [Ricardo Bion](https://github.com/ricardo-bion).  Thank you for making this great R package!

# Business Use Case For Radar Plots (RFM & Customer Segments)?

**A Radar Plot** is a way to visually compare multiple things like customer segments (or customer avatars).

**Business Use Case: RFM Analysis, Customer Segments & Customer Avatars.** One of the things I do when analyzing customers is to compare them by different measures (like frequency of purchases, monetary value purchased in past year, time since last purchase).

* It's called **RFM Analysis** (or Recency-Frequency-Monetary Analysis), when we group customers by spending habits such as how many days since last transaction, how many times they have transacted, and the total amount the customer has spent.
* A big mistake many business analysts make is not including customer features like Age and for a weight-loss company how much the customer weighs. This helps us further create **Customer Segments**.
* If done properly, we can develop **Customer Avatars**, that describe the unique groups within our data.

**Why do I bring up RFM Analysis, Customer Segments, and Customer Avatars?** Well, it's the perfect thing for a radar chart.

Here's an example of how a business can use a radar plot for RFM Analysis. This hypothetical company **sells weight loss supplements**. What can you see from the radar plot?

![](/assets/weighloss_supplement_radar-1.jpg)

<p class="date text-center">Example of a radar plot for a company that sells weightloss products</p>

We can visually see that Young Bodybuilders are our target market. They are making lots of purchases and possibly taking the supplements to cut weight before a competition.

We can also see that middle-aged athletes seem to be a newer market or possibly had more recent sales demand due to promotions. However they seem to spend less money and less frequency than the other customers (the average).

Ok, now that we know what a radar plot is and why it's useful for business analysis, now we need to get you set up with `ggplot2` guidance.

For that you're going to need...

# My Cheat Sheet For My Top 100 R Packages

The next thing you're going to need is to have access to all of the R packages that I use regularly in my data analysis projects.

Why?

**Even I forget which R packages to use from time to time.** And this cheat sheet saves me so much time. Instead of googling to filter through 20,000 R packages to find a needle in a haystack. I keep my cheat sheet handy so I know which to use and when to use them. Seriously. [This cheat sheet is my bible.](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html)

![](/assets/free_cheatsheet.jpg)

Once you [download it](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html), head to page 1 and you'll see the `ggplot2` package I use for Data Visualization.

![](/assets/2021-08-12-ggalt-dumbbell-plots/ultimate_r_cheatsheet_ggplot2.jpg)

Beyond ggplot2, you'll be able to learn even more R packages. You get 100 R packages broken down by category, which is important when you want to work in these fields:

* Machine Learning
* Time Series
* Financial Analysis
* Geospatial Analysis
* Text Analysis and NLP
* Shiny Web App Development

[So steal my cheat sheet.](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) It will save you a ton of time.

# Tutorial: Radar Plots with `ggradar`

I want to show off how quickly you can make radar plots in this tutorial with the `ggradar` package, which extends `ggplot2` for radar plots. I've seen tutorials in Python where it takes 10-20X the amount of code with matplotlib. So `ggradar` is a massive productivity enhancer.

<p class="date text-center">Making radar plots for within-group analysis (e.g. comparing customer segments)</p>

**I'm constantly doing within-group analysis.** So that's what I'm focusing on here. In the [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/-xgxA8I9PJY) I show off the correlation and similarity which can help you find similar groups within your data.

## Step 1: Load the libraries and data

To get set up, all we need to do is load the following libraries and data.

![](/assets/explore_01_libraries.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

We'll use the `mpg` dataset, which has data on 234 vehicle models.

![](/assets/explore_02_mpg.jpg)

With data in hand, we are ready to create the automatic EDA report. Let's explore!

## Step 2: Shiny EDA App

Next, use `explore()` to make our EDA shiny app.

![](/assets/explore_03_shiny_app.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

This produces an automatic Shiny EDA App that covers all of the important aspects that we need to analyze in our data! It's that simple folks.

The shiny app is great, but the next thing you're probably wondering is how the heck am I going to use this report.

**That's why I want to show you...**

# BONUS: How To Do Bivariate Analysis with the Shiny EDA App

As an extra special bonus, I figured I'd teach you not only how to make the Shiny EDA App BUT how to use the app too. Here's how to get the most out of your automatic EDA analysis tool. If you'd like to **get the code to produce the individual plots**, just [sign up for my FREE R-tips codebase](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter). You'll get all the code sent to your email plus more R-Tips every week.

## 1. Box Plot (Numeric Target + Categorical Predictor)

![](/assets/explore_boxplot.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

**The first plot we get is a box plot,** which is when we compare a numeric target and a categorical predictor. The box plot helps us see which categories pull fuel economy up and down.

**Business Insights:**

* Pickups and SUVs tend to pull highway fuel economy down
* Compact and midsize have the highest fuel economy

## 2. Frequency Plot (Categorical vs Categorical)

![](/assets/explore_frequency_plot.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

**The 2nd plot we get is a frequency plot,** which is when we compare two categories and determine the overlap in terms of the frequency of observations that fall into combinations of categories. This plot won't help us with figuring out effect on fuel economy (highway mpg), but can be important in data discover.

**Business Insights:**

* Chevrolet dominates the 2seater category, and Dodge dominates the minivan category
* The most competitive categories are Midsize and SUV

## 3. Scatter Plot (Numeric vs Numeric)

![](/assets/explore_scatterplot.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

**The 3rd plot we get is a scatter plot,** which is when we compare two numeric variables and determine the trend between the two variables. This plot helps us see an immediate trend between highway fuel economy and engine size (displacement).

**Business Insights:**

* As engine size (displacement) goes up, highway fuel economy goes down. This is an inverse relationship.

# Conclusion

You learned how to use the `explore` library to automatically create an exploratory data analysis shiny app AND perform bivariate analysis the fast way. Great work! **But, there's a lot more to becoming a data scientist.**
