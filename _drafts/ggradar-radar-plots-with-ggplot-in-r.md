Let's face it. These days, everything is built off of comparisons. In business, we compare customers, products, service providers, hotel chains, doctors offices, revenue by verticals... And we do this to find insights within groups of our data.

**Groups are important (think customer segments). But group-wise comparisons can be tricky.**  Thankfully an R package exists to help us compare within groups using a visualization called a Radar Plot.

**What R package is it?** It's called `ggradar`. And I want to share it with you so you can do business comparisons (like customers with RFM Analysis) in under 10-minutes. Here's what you learn in this R-Tip:

1. **How to use Radar Plots in Business (Customer Segments, Avatars, & RFM Analysis)**
2. How to make Radar plots with `ggradar`
3. **BONUS: How to sort the radar plots using similarity (important for identifying similar customers and products)**

# Thank You Developers.

Before we dive into `ggradar`, I want to take a moment to thank the data scientist and developer of ggradar, [Ricardo Bion](https://github.com/ricardo-bion).  Thank you for making this great R package!

# Business Use Case For Radar Plots (RFM & Customer Segments)?

**A Radar Plot** is a way to visually compare multiple things like customer segments (or customer avatars).

**Business Use Case: RFM Analysis, Customer Segments & Customer Avatars.** One of the things I do when analyzing customers is to compare them by different measures (like frequency of purchases, monetary value purchased in past year, time since last purchase).

* It's called **RFM Analysis** (or Recency-Frequency-Monetary Analysis), when we group customers by spending habits such as how many days since last transaction, how many times they have transacted, and the total amount the customer has spent.
* A big mistake many business analysts make is not including customer features like Age and for a weight-loss company how much the customer weighs. This helps us further create **Customer Segments**.
* If done properly, we can develop **Customer Avatars**, that describe the unique groups within our data.

**Why do I bring up RFM Analysis, Customer Segments, and Customer Avatars?** Well, it's the perfect thing for a radar chart.

Here's an example of how a business can use a radar plot for RFM Analysis. This hypothetical company **sells weight loss supplements**. What can you see from the radar plot?

![](/assets/weighloss_supplement_radar-2.jpg)

<p class="date text-center">Example of a radar plot for a company that sells weight-loss products (Useful for customer avatars, segments, & RFM Analysis)</p>

We can visually see that "Young Bodybuilders" are our target market. They are making lots of purchases and possibly taking the supplements to cut weight before a competition.

We can also see that "Middle-Aged Athletes" seem to be a newer market or possibly had more recent sales demand due to promotions. However they seem to spend less money and less frequency than the other customers (the average).

Ok, now that we know what a radar plot is and why it's useful for business analysis, now we need to get you set up with `ggplot2` guidance.

For that you're going to need...

# My Cheat Sheet For My Top 100 R Packages

The next thing you're going to need is to have access to all of the R packages that I use regularly in my data analysis projects.

Why?

**Even I forget which R packages to use from time to time.** And this cheat sheet saves me so much time. Instead of googling to filter through 20,000 R packages to find a needle in a haystack. I keep my cheat sheet handy so I know which to use and when to use them. Seriously. [This cheat sheet is my bible.](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html)

![](/assets/free_cheatsheet.jpg)

Once you [download it](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html), head to page 1 and you'll see the `ggplot2` package I use for Data Visualization.

![](/assets/2021-08-12-ggalt-dumbbell-plots/ultimate_r_cheatsheet_ggplot2.jpg)

Beyond ggplot2, you'll be able to learn even more R packages. You get 100 R packages broken down by category, which is important when you want to work in these fields:

* Machine Learning
* Time Series
* Financial Analysis
* Geospatial Analysis
* Text Analysis and NLP
* Shiny Web App Development

[So steal my cheat sheet.](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) It will save you a ton of time.

# Tutorial: Radar Plots with `ggradar`

I want to show off how quickly you can make radar plots in this tutorial with the `ggradar` package, which extends `ggplot2` for radar plots. I've seen tutorials in Python where it takes 50 to 100 lines of code with matplotlib. So `ggradar` is a massive productivity enhancer. **We'll make some awesome radar plots in 10 lines of code.**

![](/assets/ggradar_vehicle_plot.jpg)

<p class="date text-center">Making radar plots for within-group analysis (e.g. comparing customer segments)</p>

**I'm constantly doing within-group analysis.** So that's what I'm focusing on here. In the [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/-xgxA8I9PJY) I show off the correlation and similarity which can help you find similar groups within your data.

## Step 1: Load the libraries and data

To get set up, all we need to do is load the following libraries and data.

![](/assets/ggradar_libraries_data.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

We'll use the `mpg` dataset, which has data on 234 vehicle models.

![](/assets/explore_02_mpg.jpg)

With data in hand, we are ready to create the automatic EDA report. Let's explore!

## Step 2: Data Wrangling

We're going to do **within-group analysis**. So we just need to summarize by group.

* Vehicle Class is the **group** in our data set
* The **summary metric** is going to be the median displacement, highway fuel economy, city fuel economy, and number of cylinders
* We'll need to **rescale** each of the numeric variable to be between 0 and 1 (so they appear correctly on the radar chart)

![](/assets/ggradar_data_wrangling.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

This produces the within-group data that has been rescaled and is ready for `ggradar`

![](/assets/ggradar_formatted_data.jpg)

## Step 3. Make a Radar Plot

Radar plots make within-group analysis a visual experience.

* A simple radar plot is only 1 line of code.
* And a custom faceted radar plot isn't bad either once you know `ggplot2`

  **Pro-Tip:** [Use my R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) for customized plotting.

### Simple Radar Plot

Making a radar plot is as simple as 1 line of code.

![](/assets/ggradar_simple.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

Here's the default data visualization. It's not going to win any data-viz awards, but we're on the right track.

![](/assets/ggradar_basic.jpg)

## Customizing the Simple Radar Plot

With just a few tweaks, I can upgrade my within-group analysis and begin to get some business insights.

![](/assets/ggradar_basic_custom.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

...which produces this data visualization.

![](/assets/ggradar_basic_custom_plot.jpg)

Great, now I can see that there are **key business insights** based on their similarities:

* SUV and Pickup are similar
* Compact, Subcompact, and Midsize are similar
* 2-Seater and Minivans are outliers

Next, I want to break these out so I can really expose their trends.

## Faceted Radar

The faceted radar plot is a bit more code because of the formatting. Again, I recommend using the [ggplot2 links in my R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html)... These are a savior for remembering the ggplot theme options.

As a YouTube Bonus, I show you how to order the faceted radar plot. Here are the links to reproduce:
