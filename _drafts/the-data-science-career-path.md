It was 2018 and Mohana was a struggling business analyst. He'd been getting a measly 3.5% raise since he joined his company.

Then in 2019 he got 1 raise (10%)...

In 6-months Mohana got another raise (this time 26%)...

And, then in just another 2 months (40% hike).

#### **In total, in under one year Mohana got a total of 94% increase in his salary!**

Today, Mohana is the Lead Data Scientist, at a Company called Money View - one of India's fastest growing startups in India that [just recently closed a $75-Million Dollar Series D Round](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/money-view/company_financials) of investments.

Mohana is kicking butt, this time in a different capacity.

As Lead Data Scientist, he's helping Money View grow their talented and high-productivity team as the move into a new phase of startup growth.

I told Mohana how happy I was of him.

But how was Mohana able to double (2X) his salary in under 12-months?

What did he do to climb the career latter so quickly and land a job where ever he wanted?

And how did he maneuver his career into to working at a leading startup, Money View, where he's now responsible for growing a team as a Lead Data Scientist?

## **The rest of this post will show you exactly how Mohana did it.**

This post includes [career research from Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/), and case studies from 2 data scientists that are growing their careers faster than I've ever seen anyone do it. In this post, we'll answer questions like:

* What data science roles exist? (and which to steer clear of)
* The career path for a data scientist (you start at $125,000)
* How to get promoted to Senior and Lead Data Scientist (you start at $150,000)
* How to make a splash (How one data scientist saved his company $5 Million per year annually)
* How to 2X your salary in 1-year

# 1. What data science roles exist? (and which to steer clear of)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science and Analytics Job Roles</p>

The first question that comes to mind when you are learning about data science or trying to figure your way through is which roles exist?

There are 4 main categories:

We can see from the table that in general Data Science, Machine Learning, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) being compensated 40% more than Business Analyst positions.

So it's clear that you want to avoid Business Analyst (more on this in a minute). 

We can also see that depending on your interest (general data science vs specialized NLP) that there tends to be more pay for more specialization. 

But, we'll also see that pay will increase as your position changes from entry-level to senior/lead data scientist (coming shortly, hang in there).

But first, what do each of these data science roles do?

## What do each of the data science roles do?

I've written extensively about [the differences between each of the data science and analytics job roles here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2021/01/21/machine-learning-jobs.html), but I'll briefly recap:

* **Data Scientists** are focused on experimentation, research, statistical analysis, and generating business insights through machine learning models and predictive applications. Their tool of choice is code in R or Python. 
* **Machine Learning Engineers** are needed for taking models into production, supporting and maintaining models, and keeping the business automations running. 

With that said, in the past,
