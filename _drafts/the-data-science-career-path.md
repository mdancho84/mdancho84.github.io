It was 2018 and Mohana was a struggling business analyst. He'd been getting a measly 3.5% raise since he joined his company.

Then in 2019 he got 1 raise (10%)...

In 6-months Mohana got another raise (this time 26%)...

And, then in just another 2 months (40% hike).

#### **In total, in under one year Mohana got a total of 94% increase in his salary!**

Today, Mohana is the Lead Data Scientist, at a Company called Money View - one of India's fastest growing startups in India that [just recently closed a $75-Million Dollar Series D Round](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/money-view/company_financials) of investments.

Mohana is kicking butt, this time in a different capacity.

As Lead Data Scientist, he's helping Money View grow their talented and high-productivity team as the move into a new phase of startup growth.

I told Mohana how happy I was of him.

#### But how was Mohana able to double (2X) his salary in under 12-months?

What did he do to climb the career latter so quickly and land a job where ever he wanted?

And how did he maneuver his career into to working at a leading startup, Money View, where he's now responsible for growing a team as a Lead Data Scientist?

## **The rest of this post will show you exactly how Mohana did it.**

This post includes [career research from Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/), and case studies from 2 data scientists that are growing their careers faster than I've ever seen anyone do it. In this post, we'll answer questions like:

* What data science roles exist? (and which to steer clear of)
* The career path for a data scientist (you start at $125,000)
* How to get promoted to Senior and Lead Data Scientist (you start at $150,000)
* How to make a splash (How one data scientist saved his company $5 Million per year annually)
* How to 2X your salary in 1-year

# 1. What data science roles exist? (and which to steer clear of)

![](/assets/data_science_job_roles.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science and Analytics Job Roles</p>

The first question that comes to mind when you are learning about data science or trying to figure your way through is which roles exist?

There are 4 main categories:

![](/assets/job_salaries_by_role.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science Job Salaries (Glassdoor 2022)</p>

We can see from the table that in general Data Science, Machine Learning, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) being compensated 40% more than Business Analyst positions.

So it's clear that you want to _avoid_ Business Analyst (more on this in a minute).

We can also see that depending on your interest (general data science vs specialized NLP) that there tends to be _more pay_ _for more specialization_.

But, we'll also see that pay will increase as your position changes from entry-level to senior/lead data scientist (coming shortly, hang in there).

But first, what do each of these data science roles do?

## What do each of the data science roles do?

I've written extensively about [the differences between each of the data science and analytics job roles here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2021/01/21/machine-learning-jobs.html), but I'll briefly recap in this table:

![](/assets/data_science_job_roles_description-1.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science Job Roles Uncovered</p>

We can see that it's more typical for the hard-core engineering disciplines to use Python versus the more business analytical disciplines to use R/Python and Excel/PowerBI/Tableau.

If you are looking to move from Business Analysis to Data Science, we can see from the chart that you should add: R or Python to your skillset.

I explain in-depth exactly [which skills are important to become a data scientist here](https://www.business-science.io/careers/2022/03/11/which-data-science-skills-are-important.html).

## What about Data Engineering?

The question I always get at this point is what about Data Engineering?

Well, that's a great question. Let me explain why Data Engineering is not in the table.

Here's a typical conversation between a Business Analyst and a Data Engineer.

![](/assets/business_analyst_data_engineer.jpeg)

<p class="text-center date">Typical conversation between a Business Analyst and a Data Engineer (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-data-engineer-d65293272121">Day in the Life of a Data Engineer</a>)</p>

So, Data Engineering is really a support role. And what Data Engineers do is give data to the Business Analysts and Data Scientists in a nice tidy looking format that comes from what they call a "data pipeline".

Data Engineers regularly deal with:

* Development of a data pipeline/API/microservice.
* Setup/Maintenance infrastructure
* Fixing bugs, improving code base, documentation

Let me make this point to conclude: **Data Engineers are valuable (if not essential to data science success).**

But since we are focused on the Data Science career path, it's more important to focus on downstream activities like production and business results rather than upstream tasks like data processing.

## Why you should not go for NLP or Machine Learning Engineering

If you want to migrate into these specialized roles from a Data Scientist position, then I'm all for that.

But, you're best served learning data science first before moving into the more specialized fields.

Remember, you can always learn more later (become specialized), but in the beginning it's important to gain general business and data science experience.

## Why you must avoid a business analyst position RIGHT NOW

**Popular Opinion:** People should start as a business analyst, work there 2-4 years, and then migrated into data scientist positions.

**Matt's Opinion:** People are regularly getting 50% raises by snatching up data scientist positions. You should do that.

We are in a once-in-a-lifetime generational disparity between the number of data scientists available (supply) and the number of positions needed (demand).

![](/assets/massive_labor_shortage.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Massive Labor Shortage!</p>

Because of COVID, there's a bullwhip-effect in the US labor market. Let me explain.

In response to COVID, governments enforced a shutdown, forcing labor to decline swiftly and without notice.

Upon reopening, not all workers came back. This created a supply imbalance forcing companies to fill spots any way they could.

## Poaching insanity

So what happened next is a once in a lifetime generational supply/demand imbalance that is working in your favor.

Companies began poaching data scientists from other companies stealing their highest value assets: their employees.

![](/assets/buzzfeed_poaching.jpeg)

And the training time for most new hires is 1-2 years, so companies either had to offer higher salaries and benefits or be at risk of data scientists being poached.

Now you benefit.

Because you can SKIP the whole "business analyst -> data scientist" game and...

Jump right into Data Scientist roles.

## **How to jump right into data scientist roles**

If you want to jump right into data scientist roles, check out these 2 articles:

1. [Which data science skills are important (To get a $50,000 increase in salary)](https://www.business-science.io/careers/2022/03/11/which-data-science-skills-are-important.html)
2. [How To Become A Financial Data Scientist (Or A Data Scientist In Any Domain)](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/05/23/how-to-become-a-fiancial-data-scientist.html)

Now that you know data science is right for you, let's show you how to get promoted to Senior and Lead Data Scientist (to make $150,000/yr).

# 3. How to get promoted to Senior & Lead Data Scientist (Make $150,000/yr)

First, let's cover the career path for a data scientist, which for 85% of organizations looks like this:

![](/assets/data_science_career_path-2.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science Career Path - Flow Chart</p>

I've done the hard work of doing all the research on each of the positions. Here's what it looks like in table form:

![](/assets/data_science_career_path_table.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science Career Path - Compensation</p>

The things you need to think about are:

1. How to get to Senior / Lead Data Scientist as fast as possible ($150,000 - $160,000)
2. Pick a path - Strategic or Technical
3. Then keep repeating until you get to the top

## The General Path

Most organizations have a general track which will take you to a Lead Data Scientist. The path looks like this:

![](/assets/general_path.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">The General Path</p>

### You start as a data scientist

You'll start at data scientist making around $125,000 per year in total compensation. All you need to do is [get the skills listed here](https://www.business-science.io/careers/2022/03/11/which-data-science-skills-are-important.html).

In fact, I even made a convenient cheat sheet to make it even easier ([which you can download for free here](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet)).

**And a Pro-Tip:** Skip the Business Analyst position. Companies NEED YOU right now. Get the skills and go for it!

### Next, you'll become a Senior Data Scientist.

These guys and gals make $150,000 per year in total compensation. And they are more experienced, probably have some cloud experience (AWS, Docker, Git), and can do more advanced analyses when compared to the regular data scientists.

So learn cloud. Learn Docker and Git. And learn to do more advanced analyses: Time Series, NLP, and Web Applications.

### Next, you'll become a Lead Data Scientist

These fellas make $160,000 per year in total compensation. And what really separates the Leads from the Seniors is their ability to work with Management, craft persuasive arguments, deliver insights (in the face of scrutiny), and they have [well developed EQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence) (not just IQ).

So learn to make and deliver presentations, work with others well, and build persuasive arguments.

### Let's put this ALL together (comparing Senior/Lead vs Data Scientist)

If you really want to compare these 3 job general job roles, then I'll make it even simpler for you. Just learn these skills.

<p class="text-center date">Comparing Senior/Lead vs Data Scientist</p>

## The Technical Path vs Strategic Path

Next, we need to consider where you go over that. You see, there are two paths... so choose wisely.

![](/assets/strategic_vs_technical.jpg)

Listen, I'll give you my perspective and how I chose when it was my time.

You see back in the day, before I was this fancy educator. I was a data scientist without a title (it was before "data scientist" existed in my previous employer).

 I worked at a small company called Bonney Forge. I went into Management.

Why? Because I loved the idea of influencing the direction of the company. 

I was entrepreneurial, and enjoyed working with people. And I loved strategy. 

![](/assets/chess_game.jpg)

Business was like a game of chess and I wanted to master it. My customers were my unsuspecting opponent. And I used data science to **checkmate** them into more revenue. 

## How do we get there?

Alright, so let's dive in.

Here's the playbook. Monday-morning quarterback-style.

# Two ways to getting promotions (FAST)

The 2-ways to getting promotions fast:

1. Be more productive than everyone else.
2. Do something big!! (and repeat)

I'm a big fan of case-studies (it's what we do in MBA school), and they work. So let's cover some case studies of how to get promoted.

# 4. Case Study: How one data scientist 2X'ed his salary in 1-year

People are lazy.

You can take advantage of the simple fact that people get comfortable. It's easy to do.

In fact, here's the story of how Mohana did it (remember Mohana from the beginning of this article?).

Mohana got 3 raises in the span of a year totaling a 94% increase.

So if his salary was $75,000 starting out. By the end of the year his salary was $150,000.

## So, how did he do it?

Well, here's his testimonial. A case study in investing in yourself.

![](/assets/mohana-increase-salary-messages.png)

Mohana says, _"I just wanted to thank you again. You are my career saviour."_

He continues, _"Before when I had no idea abot you and your courses, my growth as an analyst just sucked! I got a hike of 3.5% \[per year\]."_

So what changed?

Mohana enrolled in my [5-Course R-Track Program](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series).

That's when the flood of raises started.

Mohana exlaims, _"After your entry into my life, I got a 10% hike, and then a 26% hike, and then a 40% hike"._

Let's dive into how Mohana increased his productivity.

## 3X-ing his productivity with my R-courses

Here's the scoop. Mohana was working with a bunch of Python coders.

These guys are slow and comfortable.

But Mohana isn't like them. He's motivated.

Mohana just needs a little edge.

And, Mohana got that when he met Matt Dancho (me). :)

You see I gave him the edge he needed to tripple (yes, tripple!) his productivity.

How did I do this?

I taught him the way I code in R.

I taught him how to make hundreds of machine learning models in minutes.

I taught him the secrets to unlocking shiny web apps that his organization can use.

And, I taught him the hidden way to scale time series to 1000's of forecasts in minutes.

Then, Mohana simply applied what I taught him to his company.

## Now he's a Lead Data Scientist

Mohana kept repeating. He kept growing.

Today he's now the Lead Data Scientist at Money View, one of the fastest growing startups in India. And they are about to grow even faster with the [$75-Million Series D round](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/money-view/company_financials) of investment they just received.

And, this is what I live for. Seeing my students succeed like this.

But that's just one case. I couldn't possibly duplicate it could I?

Let's see.
