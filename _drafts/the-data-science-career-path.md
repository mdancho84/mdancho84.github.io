It was 2018 and Mohana was a struggling business analyst. He'd been getting a measly 3.5% raise since he joined his company. 

Then in 2019 he got 1 raise (10%)... 

In 6-months Mohana got another raise (this time 26%)...

And, then in just another 2 months (40% hike). 

**In total, in under one year Mohana got a total of 94% increase in his salary!**

Today, Mohana is the Lead Data Scientist, at a Company called Money View - one of India's fastest growing startups that [just recently closed a $75-Million Dollar Series D Round](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/money-view/company_financials). 

Mohana is still kicking butt, this time in a different capacity. As Lead Data Scientist, he's helping Money View grow their talented and high-productivity team as the move into a new phase of startup growth. 

But how was Mohana able to double (2X) his salary in under 12-months?

What did he do to climb the career latter so quickly and land a job where ever he wanted?

And how did he maneuver his career into to working at a leading Indian startup, Money View where he's now responsible for growing a team as a Lead Data Scientist?

The rest of this post will show you exactly how Mohana did it.
