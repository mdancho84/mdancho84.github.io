It was 2018 and Mohana was a struggling business analyst. He'd been getting a measly 3.5% raise since he joined his company.

Then in 2019 he got 1 raise (10%)...

In 6-months Mohana got another raise (this time 26%)...

And, then in just another 2 months (40% hike).

#### **In total, in under one year Mohana got a total of 94% increase in his salary!**

Today, Mohana is the Lead Data Scientist, at a Company called Money View - one of India's fastest growing startups in India that [just recently closed a $75-Million Dollar Series D Round](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/money-view/company_financials) of investments.

Mohana is kicking butt, this time in a different capacity.

As Lead Data Scientist, he's helping Money View grow their talented and high-productivity team as the move into a new phase of startup growth.

I told Mohana how happy I was of him.

#### But how was Mohana able to double (2X) his salary in under 12-months?

What did he do to climb the career latter so quickly and land a job where ever he wanted?

And how did he maneuver his career into to working at a leading startup, Money View, where he's now responsible for growing a team as a Lead Data Scientist?

## **The rest of this post will show you exactly how Mohana did it.**

This post includes [career research from Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/), and case studies from 2 data scientists that are growing their careers faster than I've ever seen anyone do it. In this post, we'll answer questions like:

* What data science roles exist? (and which to steer clear of)
* The career path for a data scientist (you start at $125,000)
* How to get promoted to Senior and Lead Data Scientist (you start at $150,000)
* How to make a splash (How one data scientist saved his company $5 Million per year annually)
* How to 2X your salary in 1-year

# 1. What data science roles exist? (and which to steer clear of)

![](/assets/data_science_job_roles.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science and Analytics Job Roles</p>

The first question that comes to mind when you are learning about data science or trying to figure your way through is which roles exist?

There are 4 main categories:

![](/assets/job_salaries_by_role.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science Job Salaries (Glassdoor 2022)</p>

We can see from the table that in general Data Science, Machine Learning, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) being compensated 40% more than Business Analyst positions.

So it's clear that you want to _avoid_ Business Analyst (more on this in a minute).

We can also see that depending on your interest (general data science vs specialized NLP) that there tends to be _more pay_ _for more specialization_.

But, we'll also see that pay will increase as your position changes from entry-level to senior/lead data scientist (coming shortly, hang in there).

But first, what do each of these data science roles do?

## What do each of the data science roles do?

I've written extensively about [the differences between each of the data science and analytics job roles here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2021/01/21/machine-learning-jobs.html), but I'll briefly recap in this table:

![](/assets/data_science_job_roles_description-1.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science Job Roles Uncovered</p>

We can see that it's more typical for the hard-core engineering disciplines to use Python versus the more business analytical disciplines to use R/Python and Excel/PowerBI/Tableau.

If you are looking to move from Business Analysis to Data Science, we can see from the chart that you should add: R or Python to your skillset.

I explain in-depth exactly [which skills are important to become a data scientist here](https://www.business-science.io/careers/2022/03/11/which-data-science-skills-are-important.html).

## What about Data Engineering?

The question I always get at this point is what about Data Engineering?

Well, that's a great question. Let me explain why Data Engineering is not in the table.

Here's a typical conversation between a Business Analyst and a Data Engineer.

![](/assets/business_analyst_data_engineer.jpeg)

<p class="text-center date">Typical conversation between a Business Analyst and a Data Engineer (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-data-engineer-d65293272121">Day in the Life of a Data Engineer</a>)</p>

So, Data Engineering is really a support role. And what Data Engineers do is give data to the Business Analysts and Data Scientists in a nice tidy looking format that comes from what they call a "data pipeline".

Data Engineers regularly deal with:

* Development of a data pipeline/API/microservice.
* Setup/Maintenance infrastructure
* Fixing bugs, improving code base, documentation

Let me make this point to conclude: **Data Engineers are valuable (if not essential to data science success).**

But since we are focused on the Data Science career path, it's more important to focus on downstream activities like production and business results rather than upstream tasks like data processing.

## Why you must avoid a business analyst position?

**Popular Opinion:** People should start as a business analyst, work there 2-4 years, and then migrated into data scientist positions.

**Matt's Opinion:** People are regularly getting 50% raises by snatching up data scientist positions. You should do that.

We are in a once in a lifetime generational disparity between the number of data scientists available (supply) and the number of positions needed (demand).

<p class="text-center date">Massive Labor Shortage!</p>

Because of COVID, there's a bullwhip-effect in the US labor market. Let me explain.

In response to COVID, governments enforced a shutdown, forcing labor to decline swiftly and without notice.

Upon reopening, not all workers came back. This created a supply imbalance forcing companies to fill spots any way they could.

## Poaching insanity

So what happened next is a once in a lifetime generational supply/demand imbalance that is working in your favor.

Companies began poaching data scientists from other companies stealing their highest value assets: their employees.

![](/assets/buzzfeed_poaching.jpeg)

And the training time for most new hires is 1-2 years, so companies either had to offer higher salaries and benefits or be at risk of data scientists being poached.

Now you benefit.

Because you can SKIP the whole "business analyst -> data scientist" game and...

Jump right into Data Scientist roles.

## **How to jump right into data scientist roles**

If you want to do so, check out these 2 articles:

1. [Which data science skills are important (To get a $50,000 increase in salary)](https://www.business-science.io/careers/2022/03/11/which-data-science-skills-are-important.html)
2. [How To Become A Financial Data Scientist (Or A Data Scientist In Any Domain)](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/05/23/how-to-become-a-fiancial-data-scientist.html)

Now that you know data science is right for you, let's show you how to get promoted to Senior and Lead Data Scientist (to make $150,000/yr).

# 3. How to get promoted to Senior & Lead Data Scientist (Make $150,000/yr)

First, let's cover the career path for a data scientist, which for 85% of organizations looks like this:

I've done the hardwork of doing all the research on each of the positions. Here's what it looks like in table form:
