If you are looking to learn about the most useful R package that I've ever made that can help you tremendously THAT you probably don't know yet, you've come to the right place, my friend!

But, I'm going to have some fun today too (I'll tell you why in a second)! So buckle up and get ready for some fun along the way.

# What's _this_ fun that Matt speaks of?

I've been learning R for the better part of a decade and for 7 of those years I've been building R packages many of which are open source (free for everyone to use).

Here's a short list of many of my open source R packages, AND I want you to guess which one I'm covering today. I've sorted by GitHub stars (We'll use this as a proxy for popularity).

# Here's what _it's_ not

**I _love_ guessing games.** You get to see why I picked what I picked (and I get to introduce you to my R packages at the same time).

As a bonus, every R package I cover here IS **super valuable**. But just not the one that IS the both valuable AND few know if it.

## It's _not_ tidyquant

Tidyquant is an incredibly useful R package for downloading and working with Financial Data (stocks, investments, and investment portfolios).

<p class="date text-center">It's not tidyquant</p>

But, with 750 GitHub stars and almost 800,000 downloads, there's a good chance you've heard of it or possibly even used it.

#### Getting started with Financial Analysis in R

**Want to get started with `tidyquant`**? (perfect if you want to get a job in Financial Analysis using R.) 

Then I have a special R Cheat Sheet that links to all of the important documentation.  You can [download the R cheat sheet for free here](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet).

#### Financial Analysis (Page 3)

To get started with Financial Analysis in R, head to **Page 3 of the cheat sheet**, and you can check out the Financial Analysis Section. 

* You'll see Tidyquant and several other Financial R Packages. 
* The links will take you to the `tidyquant` & financial software documentation.

But, I'm NOT covering `tidyquant` today. It's just too popular. Check out the Cheat Sheet for the tidyquant doc's and tutorials.

Onto the next R package...

## It's _not_ timetk

Timetk is a fantastic R package that helps bring time series analysis to the tidyverse. If you love `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, imagine being able to wrangle and visualize time series data the SAME way. That's what `timetk` does.

<p class="date text-center">It's not timetk</p>

But timetk is just _too_ popular. Timetk has been downloaded 1,400,000 times. 

#### Time Series Analysis (Page 3)

**Want to get started with Timetk?** (perfect if you have to solve time series projects for your company.) 

Check out the Time Series Analysis section on [Page 3 of my R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet).
