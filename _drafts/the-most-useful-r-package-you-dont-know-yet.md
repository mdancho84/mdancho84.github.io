If you are looking to learn about the most useful R package that I've ever made that can help you tremendously THAT you probably don't know yet, you've come to the right place, my friend!  

But, I'm going to have some fun today too (I'll tell you why in a second)! So buckle up and get ready for some fun along the way.

## What's _this_ fun that Matt speaks of?

I've been learning R for the better part of a decade and for 7 of those years I've been building R packages many of which are open source (free for everyone to use). 

Here's a short list of many of my open source R packages, AND I want you to guess which one I'm covering today. I've sorted by GitHub stars (We'll use this as a proxy for popularity).

## Which R Package do you think I'm going to cover (that you're probably not using AND is tremendously useful)?
