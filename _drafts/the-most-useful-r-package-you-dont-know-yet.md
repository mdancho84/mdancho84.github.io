If you are looking to learn about the most useful R package that I've ever made that can help you tremendously THAT you probably don't know yet, you've come to the right place, my friend!  

But, I'm going to have some fun today too (I'll tell you why in a second)! So buckle up and get ready for some fun along the way.

# What's _this_ fun that Matt speaks of?

I've been learning R for the better part of a decade and for 7 of those years I've been building R packages many of which are open source (free for everyone to use). 

Here's a short list of many of my open source R packages, AND I want you to guess which one I'm covering today. I've sorted by GitHub stars (We'll use this as a proxy for popularity).

# Here's what _it's_ not

I love guessing games. You get to see why I picked what I picked (and I get to introduce you to my R packages at the same time). 

## It's not tidyquant

[Tidyquant is an incredibly useful R package](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/) for downloading and working with Financial Data (stocks, investments, and investment portfolios).

<p class="date text-center">It's not tidyquant</p>

But, with 750 GitHub stars and almost 800,000 downloads, there's a good chance you've heard of it or possibly even used it. 

And, if you want to get started with it, I have a special R Cheat Sheet that links to all of the important documentation.  You can [download the R cheat sheet for free here](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet). 

On page 3 you can check out the Financial Analysis Section. You'll see Tidyquant and several other R packages. The links will take you to the tidyquant documentation.

But, I'm NOT covering `tidyquant` today. It's just too popular. 

## It's _not_ timetk

[Timetk is a fantastic R package](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/) that helps bring time series analysis to the tidyverse. If you love dplyr and ggplot2, imagine being able to wrangle and visualize time series data the SAME way. That's what `timetk` does.
