I can't tell you how painful it is to be better at something in Excel than in R. And one of the gripes I still have (10 years after making the switch from Excel to R) is that it's still tough to make dual-axis plots in R. 

Guess what, today is the day. I'm going to show you how to make more professional dual-axis plots in R than what I could do in Excel in my prime. Here's what you're learning today:

* How to make a dual-axis plot in R (my secret dual-plotting hack)
* **Bonus: My 3 pro tips to plot customizations (that will make your boss squeal with excitement)**

# Automate Excel with R Tutorial

Here's an Excel File you're going to make in this tutorial from R. ðŸ‘‡

<br>

## Step 1: Collect, Prepare Data & Plots

First, collect your data using `tidyquant`, an awesome package for importing & working with **Financial Data**.

### Pivot Table Data

The previous code makes this **Pivot Table** (stock returns by year and symbol).

### Time Series Stock Performance Plots

Here's the stock performance plot from the previous code.

## Step 2: Automate R to Excel

Now for the magic - Let's add the Pivot Table & Stock Plot to Excel! ðŸ”¥

1. Initialize a workbook
2. Create a worksheet
3. Add the stock plot
4. Add the Pivot Table
5. Save the workbook
6. Open the workbook (programmatically)

# ðŸ’¡ Conclusions

You learned how to use the `openxlsx` library to create automated reports using R and Excel together. Great work! **But, there's a lot more to becoming a Business Scientist.**

If you'd like to become a Business Scientist (and have an awesome career, improve your quality of life, enjoy your job, and all the fun that comes along), then I can help with that.

# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn how to apply data science to business. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.

I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever-increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

**If you feel like this, you're not alone.**

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. **Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught from a business perspective**
2. **Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.**

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will **get you past your struggles** and improve your career in the process.

It's my [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 8 projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment.

The result is that **you break through previous struggles**, learning from my experience & our community of 2653 data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
