title: How I analyze 100+ ggplots at once

**Visualizing big data is next to impossible.** As soon as I have 12 plots, that's where my ability to use native ggplot suffers. That is until I found `trelliscopejs`. 

`trelliscopejs` is like `ggplot2` faceting on steroids. This may seem crazy, but the benefit is that when you have 20, 30, or even 100+ plots you need to analyze, `trelliscopejs` is the solution! 

And, I'm going to get you up and running with `trelliscopejs` in **under 5-minutes:**

1. I'll teach you how to make 20+ ggplot facets using trelliscopejs
2. **BONUS: I'll not only show you how to make static ggplots, _but_ I'll even show you how to use the plotly integration for interactivity**
