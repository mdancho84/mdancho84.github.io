In November of 2021,  my marketing team and I had just completed a round of interviews meeting with different students. I do this every so often just to keep a pulse on my students and figure out what they needed to really become successful.

During that round of interviews, one of my students, Justin, said, _"Everything we learn in your courses is great. BUT, we never learn how to actually get the data science job."_

### **I set this aside chalking it up as just another course idea to add to the list.**

Plus everyone had been asking me to make Python courses, so I was hell-bent on creating them (even though I not so secretly dislike python... R rules).

But then 2-weeks later, at a birthday party for my niece, I was chatting with a family friend that is a Chiropractor. He had recently decided to open up his own practice and was having trouble getting clients. And costs for his business were stacking up.

Me being an entrepreneur, I wanted to help. I asked what his main problem was.

He said, _"You know I went to school to become a Chiropractor. School teaches you all of the skills needed to adjust someone's spine and help them get better. But never once did they teach me how to actually open up a chiropractor practice and market my business."_

### **I knew exactly how he felt.**

I remembered becoming a data scientist consultant and having to figure out "the hard way" about how to land clients.

And, then after getting an MBA and eventually starting my e-learning business, that no one in my MBA ever taught me how to market my business services, so I spent years figuring that out too.

And, so I gave him some strategies that I was using and now he's starting to get paying clients through the door. Sweet!

# So what does this have to do with the data science hiring process?

Well, that night I thought about Justin, the student that just a couple weeks before said, _"we never learn how to actually get the data science job \[in your or anyone else's data science program\]."_

### And that's when I knew I had to create it.

My marketing team and I agreed that we would create a "quick course" on how to get a job. Maybe spend a couple of weeks on it. 

Because getting a data science job is pretty straight-forward, right?

### **Wrong!**

About a year later, I'm one-week out from my new course launch ([please join the waitlist if you are interested](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393)).

And, I'm finally ready to document what I learned.

# The 5 mistakes to avoid in the data science hiring process

Before I jump into it, you need to understand why it took me a year to learn the hiring process.

Couldn't I just buy a book on how to get a job and apply it to the data science hiring process?

Not exactly. You see I needed to experience what tactics would work. And the best experiment is to take people that have the problem that I'm trying to solve and test tactics on them.

### **So that's what I did.**

Over the past 6-months I created an underground group of students that I met with every  2-weeks.

They purchased a secret program that gave them access to my normal [5-Course R-Track Program](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series) where they learned all of the skills that they need to become a data scientist.

And then I added one additional course, called **30-Day Data Scientist**, that taught them how to market themselves (with tricks, hacks, and tactics) to get a data science job as fast as possible.

<p class="text-center date">My experimental course</p>

### And what's crazy is it worked.

The students began getting data science jobs. Real 6-figure salary data science jobs.

Now, the experiment isn't over, but I have early results that I'm excited to share. More on this later.

But first let's talk about...

### The 5 mistakes to avoid in the data science hiring process

Here's what we'll cover in this article. And I have a special surprise at the end.

1. Don't step on hiring-process landmines
2. Don't apply in quantity (apply for quality)
3. Don't skip referrals
4. a
5. a

BONUS: Special surprise for R-users that would like help getting a data science job.

# 1. Don't step on hiring-process landmines

You might see graphics like this one that I'm about to show you. It's what I teach in my upcoming course. And it's very accurate. But there's a problem.

![](/assets/hiring_process_2.png)

<p class="text-center date">The Data Science Hiring Process</p>

The problem is that **each step is a landmine** that when stepped on will cost you extra weeks or months.

Those missteps add up, which is why many data scientists report that **it takes 9-months or longer to get a job** (after they complete their education and are fully qualified).

### That's a $75,000 cost to you

9-months may not sound like a lot, but if we were a business, no income for 9 months equals 75% of a year's salary, which is about **a $75,000 cost** even for an entry-level data science position.

To make matters worse, you have rent, bills to pay, food and gas, plus inflation is driving everything up.

So time is of the essence. And speed is important. And you need to avoid missteps in the process if you want to get a data science job quickly.

# 2. Don't apply in quantity (apply for quality)

Most people think in terms of quantity. But it's the opposite when you apply to jobs.

I heard a story of a data scientist applying to 500 jobs over 9-months and not landing any interviews.

The problem was she was applying to every company through their application system and then sending her basic resume to every single company.

But there's a big problem with this "shotgun" approach.

### Why the shotgun approach doesn't work

In January, I met with a friend of mine who is the hiring manager for data science teams at S&P Global (a big Fortune 500 company in the finance sector).

He's been part of over 100 data science hires in his 10-years and has reviewed 1000s of resumes. And he told me that each data science position gets over 1000 applications.

### But something wasn't adding up.

Now 1000s of resumes may sound like a lot, but it's actually not that many. At least not over a 10-year period. In fact, he's only reviewing 10-50 per data science position.

Why is that?

It's because they get help from an automated system called the ATS.

### They Use A Program That Auto-Scraps Your Resumes

Big companies like S&P Global, Apple, Google, Walmart, United Health, and basically all of the Fortune 500 companies get so many resumes that it's impossible to review all of them.

So they get help from the "ATS".

ATS stands for "Applicant Tracking System", and it's an automated program that compares your resume to the job description.

### The ATS is a glorified resume filtering tool

Companies like S&P get 1000 resumes in. And all then they set N, the number of resumes to something manageable like 50 or 100.

And, then like magic, 90% to 95% of candidates are removed.

So your first goal is to beat the ATS Scanner...

### Here's how to beat the ATS Scanner

I made this tool, it's a Shiny Web App that compares your resume to a job description.

<p class="text-center date">Resume Analyzer (Shiny App)</p>

Just upload your resume and a job description. And voila! A similarity score is produced.

<p class="text-center date">Scoring Your Resume vs Job Description</p>

A tool like this allows you to see the **most important keywords** to help improve the similarity score.

### Does it work?

Absolutely. It works so well that one of my students participating in my underground cohort of data science ninjas got selected for a **Staff Data Science Position ($175,000 base salary).**

The problem was that she thought she was applying to an entry-level position ($100,000 base salary).

She made it 90% of the way through the interview.

1. Her resume got selected
2. She passed the 1st round with HR
3. She passed the take-home test
4. She made it 80% through the live interview, and then she realized the position was advanced to she gracefully bowed out.

The Principal Data Scientist that was conducting the interview said, _"I don't think you're qualified for the Staff Data Scientist Position. We're going to have to bump you down to Senior Data Scientist."_

By this point our cohort was in disbelief as she was telling us this story.

<p class="text-center date">We couldn't believe what we were hearing</p>

So yes, the tools I'm talking about work. Make sure to use them for good.

### How do you get your hands on the Resume Analyzer App?

I'm going to share how the app works (live demo) on [my course launch + career training event.](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393) Attend to learn more (plus get a bunch of goodies including 5 free videos).

# 3. Don't skip referrals

99% of job applicants **apply online** and hope their resume get's picked for an interview. It might surprise you, but...

### You have less than a 1% chance of getting an interview this way

A better way is to **come in referred.** A referral is when a contact that already works at the company gives your resume and a testimonial to the hiring manager.

Most companies have a referral program where the referrer gets compensated $5,000 or more.

And...

### There is a 99% chance you get an interview if you come in referred

So you'd better come in referred if you can.

And why not? Referrers are incentivized to help you. But, there's a big problem.

They aren't going to refer you if they don't know you.

So how do you get them to know you and refer you?

### There are 2 ways to get referred

Locate your target which is the data scientist on the team that can help refer you for the position. Then do one of 3 things:

1. **One way is direct messaging on LinkedIn.** You can reach out to them. Direct message them.
2. **Another way is indirectly.** You can find a contact of a contact that you know, try to get them to persuade them via testimonial.

Now, if you really want a referral, I will give advanced guidance on my upcoming [LIVE course launch + career training event.](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393)

# 4. Don't skip the company research

# 5. Don't walk in empty handed (use a pitch deck!)

The big mistake
