In November of 2021, I was meeting with my marketing team who had just completed a round of interviews meeting with different students. We do this every so often just to keep a pulse on my students, to understand them, and figure out what they needed to really become successful.

During that round of interviews, one of my students, Justin, said, _"Everything we learn in your courses is great. BUT, we never learn how to actually get the data science job."_

I set this aside chalking it up as just another course idea to add to the list. Plus everyone had been asking me to make Python courses, so I was hell-bent on creating them (even though I not so secretly dislike python... R rules).

But then 2-weeks later, at a birthday party for my niece, I was chatting with a family friend that was a Chiropractor. He had recently decided to open up his own practice and was having trouble.

Me being an entrepreneur, I wanted to help. I asked what his main gripe was.

He said, _"You know I went to school to become a Chiropractor. The teach you all of the skills needed to adjust someone and help them get better. But never once did they teach me how to actually open up a practice and market myself."_

I knew exactly how he felt.

I remembered becoming a data scientist consultant and having to figure out "the hard way" about how to land clients.

And, then when I created my e-learning business after getting an MBA that no one ever taught me in the program how to market my business services, so I spent years figuring that out too.

And, so I gave him some strategies that I was using and now he's starting to get paying clients through the door. Sweet!

# So what does this have to do with the data science hiring process?

Well, that night I thought about Justin, the student that just a couple weeks before said, _"we never learn how to actually get the data science job."_

And that's when I knew I had to create it.

My marketing guy and I agreed that we would create a "quick course" on how to get a job. Maybe spend a couple of weeks on it. You know, because getting a job is pretty straight-forward, right?

Wrong!

About a year later, I'm one-week out from my new course launch ([please join the waitlist if you are interested](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393)).

And, I'm finally ready to document what I learned.

# The 5 things I learned from spending 1-year studying the data science hiring process

Before I jump into it, you need to understand why it took me a year to learn the hiring process. 

Couldn't I just buy a book on how to get a job and apply it to the data science hiring process?

Not exactly. You see I needed to experience what tactics would work. And the best experiment is to take people that have the problem that I'm trying to solve and test tactics on them.

So that's what I did.

Over the past 6-months I created an underground group of students that I met with every  2-weeks. I gave them access to my normal 5-Course R-Track Program where they learned all of the skills that they need to become a data scientist. And then I added one additional course, called 30-Day Data Scientist that taught them how to market themselves (with tricks, hacks, and tactics) to get a data science job as fast as possible.

And what's crazy is it worked.

The students began getting data science jobs. Real 6-figure salary data science jobs.

Now, the experiment isn't over, but we have early results that I'm excited to share.
