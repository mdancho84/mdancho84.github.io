In November of 2021, I was meeting with my marketing team who had just completed a round of interviews meeting with different students. I do this every so often just to keep a pulse on my students, to understand them, and figure out what they needed to really become successful.

During that round of interviews, one of my students, Justin, said, _"Everything we learn in your courses is great. BUT, we never learn how to actually get the data science job."_

### **I set this aside chalking it up as just another course idea to add to the list.**

Plus everyone had been asking me to make Python courses, so I was hell-bent on creating them (even though I not so secretly dislike python... R rules).

But then 2-weeks later, at a birthday party for my niece, I was chatting with a family friend that was a Chiropractor. He had recently decided to open up his own practice and was having trouble getting clients. And costs were stacking up.

Me being an entrepreneur, I wanted to help. I asked what his main gripe was.

He said, _"You know I went to school to become a Chiropractor. The teach you all of the skills needed to adjust someone and help them get better. But never once did they teach me how to actually open up a practice and market myself."_

### **I knew exactly how he felt.**

I remembered becoming a data scientist consultant and having to figure out "the hard way" about how to land clients.

And, then when I created my e-learning business after getting an MBA that no one ever taught me in the program how to market my business services, so I spent years figuring that out too.

And, so I gave him some strategies that I was using and now he's starting to get paying clients through the door. Sweet!

# So what does this have to do with the data science hiring process?

Well, that night I thought about Justin, the student that just a couple weeks before said, _"we never learn how to actually get the data science job."_

And that's when I knew I had to create it.

My marketing team and I agreed that we would create a "quick course" on how to get a job. Maybe spend a couple of weeks on it. You know, because getting a job is pretty straight-forward, right?

### **Wrong!**

About a year later, I'm one-week out from my new course launch ([please join the waitlist if you are interested](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393)).

And, I'm finally ready to document what I learned.

# The 5 mistakes to avoid in the data science hiring process

Before I jump into it, you need to understand why it took me a year to learn the hiring process.

Couldn't I just buy a book on how to get a job and apply it to the data science hiring process?

Not exactly. You see I needed to experience what tactics would work. And the best experiment is to take people that have the problem that I'm trying to solve and test tactics on them.

### **So that's what I did.**

Over the past 6-months I created an underground group of students that I met with every  2-weeks.

They purchased a secret program that gave them access to my normal [5-Course R-Track Program](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series) where they learned all of the skills that they need to become a data scientist.

And then I added one additional course, called **30-Day Data Scientist**, that taught them how to market themselves (with tricks, hacks, and tactics) to get a data science job as fast as possible.

### And what's crazy is it worked.

The students began getting data science jobs. Real 6-figure salary data science jobs.

Now, the experiment isn't over, but we have early results that I'm excited to share.

### The 5 mistakes to avoid in the data science hiring process

Here's what we'll cover in this article. And I have a special surprise at the end.

1. Each step in the hiring process is a landmine
2. Don't apply in quantity (apply for quality)
3. a
4. a
5. a

BONUS: Special surprise for R-users that would like help getting a data science job.

# 1. Each step in the hiring process is a landmine

You might see graphics like this one that I'm about to show you. It's what I teach in my upcoming course. And it's very accurate. But there's a problem.

<p class="text-center date">The Data Science Hiring Process</p>

The problem is that each step is a landmine that when stepped on will cost you extra weeks or months. Those missteps add up, which is why many data scientists report that it takes 9-months or longer to get a job (after they complete their education and are fully qualified).

### That's a $75,000 cost

9-months may not sound like a lot, but in business return, 9 months equals 75% of a year's salary, which is about a $75,000 cost even for an entry-level data science position.

To make matters worse, you have rent, bills to pay, food and gas, plus inflation is driving everything up. 

So time is of the essence. And speed is important. And you need to avoid missteps in the process if you want to get a data science job quickly. 

# 2. Don't apply in quantity (apply for quality)

Most people think in terms of quantity. But it's the opposite when you apply to jobs.

I heard a story of a data scientist applying to 500 jobs over 9-months and not landing any interviews.

The problem was she was applying to every company through their application system and then sending her basic resume to every single company.

But there's a big problem with this "shotgun" approach.

### Why the shotgun approach doesn't work

In January, I met with a friend of mine who is the hiring manager for data science teams at S&P Global (a big Fortune 500 company in the finance sector). 

He's been part of over 100 data science hires in his 10-years and has reviewed 1000s of resumes. And he told me that each data science position gets over 1000 applications. 

### But something wasn't adding up. 

Now 1000s of resumes may sound like a lot, but it's actually not that many. At least not over a 10-year period. In fact, he's only reviewing 10-50 per data science position. 

Why is that?

It's because they get help from an automated system called the ATS. 

### They Use A Program That Auto-Scraps Your Resumes

Big companies like S&P Global, Apple, Google, Walmart, United Health, and basically all of the Fortune 500 companies get so many resumes that it's impossible to review all of them. 

So they get help from the "ATS".

ATS stands for "Applicant Tracking System", and it's an automated program that compares your resume to the job description.
