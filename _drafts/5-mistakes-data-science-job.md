In November of 2021,  my marketing team and I had just completed a round of interviews meeting with different students. I do this every so often just to keep a pulse on my students and figure out what they needed to really become successful.

During that round of interviews, one of my students, Justin, said, _"Everything we learn in your courses is great. BUT, we never learn how to actually get the data science job."_

### **I set this aside chalking it up as just another course idea to add to the list.**

But then 2-weeks later, at a birthday party for my niece, I was chatting with a family friend that is a Chiropractor. He had recently decided to open up his own practice and was having trouble getting clients. And costs for his business were stacking up.

Me being an entrepreneur, I wanted to help. I asked what his main problem was.

He said, _"You know I went to school to become a Chiropractor. School teaches you all of the skills needed to adjust someone's spine and help them get better. But never once did they teach me how to actually open up a chiropractor practice and market my business."_

### **I knew exactly how he felt.**

I remembered becoming a data scientist consultant and having to figure out "the hard way" about how to land clients.

And, then after getting an MBA and eventually starting my e-learning business. I felt unprepared because no one in my MBA taught me how to market my business services. So I spent years figuring that out too.

And, so I gave him some strategies that I was using and now he's starting to get paying clients through the door. Sweet!

# So what does this have to do with the data science hiring process?

Well, that night I thought about Justin, the student that just a couple weeks before said, _"we never learn how to actually get the data science job \[in your or anyone else's data science program\]."_

### And that's when I knew I had to create it.

My marketing team and I agreed that we would create a "quick course" on how to get a job. Maybe spend a couple of weeks on it.

Because getting a data science job is pretty straight-forward, right?

### **Wrong!**

About a year later, I'm one-week out from my new course launch ([please join the waitlist if you are interested](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393)).

And, I'm finally ready to document what I learned.

# The 5 mistakes to avoid in the data science hiring process

Before I jump into it, you need to understand why it took me a year to learn the hiring process.

Couldn't I just buy a book on how to get a job and apply it to the data science hiring process?

Not exactly. You see I needed to experience what tactics would work. And the best experiment is to take people that have the problem that I'm trying to solve and test tactics on them.

### **So that's what I did.**

Over the past 6-months I created an underground group of students that I met with every  2-weeks.

They purchased a secret program that gave them access to my normal [5-Course R-Track Program](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series) where they learned all of the skills that they need to become a data scientist.

And then I added one additional course, called **30-Day Data Scientist**, that taught them how to market themselves (with tricks, hacks, and tactics) to get a data science job as fast as possible.

<p class="text-center date">My experimental course</p>

Now keep in mind that everything I'm about to share with you was tested in an experimental study. But...

### What's crazy is it worked.

The students began getting data science jobs. **Real 6-figure salary data science jobs.**

Now, the experiment isn't over, but I have early results that I'm excited to share. More on this shortly.

But first let's talk about...

# The 5 mistakes to avoid in the data science hiring process

Avoid these 5 critical mistakes to help **speed up** the data science hiring process for you.

1. **You are stepping on hiring-process landmines**
2. **You are applying in quantity (apply for quality)**
3. **You are skipping referrals**
4. **Don't forget to come with THIS secret weapon (it will set you apart)**
5. **You talked too much about data science**

**BONUS:** [Special surprise](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393) for R-users that would like help getting a data science job.

# 1. You are stepping on hiring-process landmines

This is what the data science hiring process looks like according to a Senior Group Manager of Data Science at S&P Global (Fortune 500 Company, Finance Industry). But there's a big problem.

![](/assets/hiring_process_2.png)

<p class="text-center date">The Data Science Hiring Process</p>

The problem is that **each step is a landmine** that when stepped on will cost you extra weeks or months.

Those missteps add up, which is why some data scientists report that [**it takes 2-years or longer to get a job**](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-took-me-so-long-to-land-a-data-scientist-job-c2dee99b98ca) (after they complete their education and are fully qualified).

### That's a $200,000 cost to you.

No income for 2-years equals 2X of a year's salary, which is about **a $200,000 cost** even for an entry-level data science position.

To make matters worse, you have rent, bills to pay, food and gas, plus inflation is driving everything up.

**So time is of the essence.** Speed is important. And you need to avoid missteps in the process if you want to get a data science job quickly.

### So what missteps are you making that's costing you time & money?

The next 4 mistakes are the most common missteps in the data science hiring process.

# 2. You're applying in quantity (apply for quality)

Most people think in terms of quantity. But it's the opposite when you apply to jobs.

I heard a story of a data scientist applying to 500 jobs over 9-months and not landing any interviews.

The problem was she was applying to every company through their application system and then sending her basic resume to every single company.

But there's a big problem with this "shotgun" approach.

### Why the shotgun approach doesn't work

In January, I met with a friend of mine who is the hiring manager for data science teams at S&P Global (a big Fortune 500 company in the finance sector).

He's been part of over 100 data science hires in his 10-years and has reviewed 1000's of resumes. And he told me that each data science position at S&P Global gets over 1000 applications.

### But something wasn't adding up.

Now 1000's of resumes may sound like a lot, but it's actually not that many. At least not over a 10-year period. In fact, he's only reviewing 10-50 per data science position.

Why is that?

It's because they get help from an automated system called the ATS.

### 90% of Fortune 500 Companies Use A Program That Auto-Scraps Your Resumes

[According to this article](https://medium.com/swlh/90-of-fortune-500-companies-use-an-applicant-tracking-system-whats-it-5a6b6d25e5e7), 90% of Fortune 500 Companies are using an Applicant Tracking System or ATS.

This means that companies like S&P Global, Apple, Google, Walmart, United Health, and basically all of **the Fortune 500 companies get so many resumes** that it's impossible to review all of them.

So they get help from the "ATS" Program.

ATS stands for "Applicant Tracking System", and it's an automated program that compares your resume to the job description.

### The ATS is a glorified resume filtering tool

Companies like S&P get 1000 resumes in. And all then they set N, the number of resumes to something manageable like 50 or 100.

And, then like magic, 90% to 95% of candidates are removed.

So your first goal is to beat the ATS Scanner...

### Here's how to beat the ATS Scanner

I made this tool, it's a Shiny Web App that compares your resume to a job description.

![](/assets/resume-analyzer-1.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Resume Analyzer (Shiny App)</p>

Just upload your resume and a job description. And voila! A similarity score is produced.

![](/assets/resume-analyzer-3.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Scoring Your Resume vs Job Description</p>

A tool like this allows you to see the **most important keywords** to help improve the similarity score.

### Does it work?

Absolutely. It works so well that one of my students participating in my underground cohort of future data scientists got her resume selected for a **Staff Data Science Position ($175,000 base salary).**

The problem was that she thought she was applying to an entry-level position ($100,000 base salary).

### She made it 90% of the way through the interview for a position she was unqualified for.

Here's why this is so amazing:

1. **Her resume got selected**
2. **She passed the 1st round with HR**
3. **She passed the take-home test**
4. **She was invited to a live interview for a Staff Data Scientist Position ($175,000 position)**
5. **She met with the Principal Data Scientist ($200,000 position)**
6. **She made it 90% through the 2nd interview with the Principal Data Scientist, and then she gracefully bowed out when she realized that the position was too advanced.**

The Principal Data Scientist that was conducting the interview said, _"I don't think you're qualified for the Staff Data Scientist Position. We're going to have to bump you down to Senior Data Scientist."_

By this point our cohort was in disbelief as she was telling us this story.

![](/assets/almost_becoming_a_staff_data_scientist.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">We couldn't believe what we were hearing. She literally made it 95% through the interview.</p>

So yes, the tools I'm talking about work.

### How do you get your hands on the Resume Analyzer App?

I'm going to share how the app works (live demo) on [my course launch + career training event.](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393) Attend to learn more (plus get a bunch of goodies including 5 free videos).

### The next most common mistake is...

# 3. You are skipping referrals

99% of job applicants **apply online** and hope their resume get's picked for an interview. It might surprise you, but...

### You have less than a 1% chance of getting an interview this way.

A better way is to **come in referred.** A referral is when a contact that already works at the company gives your resume and a testimonial to the hiring manager.

Most companies have a referral program where the referrer gets compensated $5,000 or more.

And...

### There is a 99% chance you get an interview if you come in referred.

So you'd better come in referred if you can.

And why not? Referrers are incentivized to help you. But, there's a big problem.

They aren't going to refer you if they don't know you. So how do you get them to know you and refer you?

### There are 2 ways to get referred

Locate your target which is the data scientist on the team that can help refer you for the position. Then do one of 3 things:

1. **One way is direct messaging on LinkedIn.** You can reach out to them. Direct message them. Build a relationship over time.
2. **Another way is indirectly.** You can find a contact of a contact that you know, try to get them to persuade them via testimonial. This can be much faster. But you have to depend on your connections and hope that the target contact is persuaded to refer you.

## How to come in referred?

Now, if you really want a referral, I will give advanced guidance on my upcoming [LIVE course launch + career training event.](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393)

And, I'll show you how you can gain my testimonial and I'll actually go to bat for you like I've done for one of my students here.

<p class="text-center date">I'm going to bat for one of my students</p>

### Once you're referred, you're in right?

Well sort of. You have a 99% chance of getting an interview.

**But you still have to pass the interview**, which is why I'm going to share the next 2 missteps that you are more than likely going to make.

# 4. You didn't come in with a good pitch

When I began consulting, I quickly realized that I needed to do 2 things in order to virtually lock in a client.

First, I needed to come prepared. I did research on the company. I asked questions to my contacts and anyone they could point me to. And I knew their problems better than the company did.

Second, I made a simple slide deck that pitched myself as the solution to their problems.

### What does consulting have to do with getting a data science job?

Every data science consulting gig I got started with an interview. I had to pull them in, show them my value, and convey that I was the solution to their problem.

If I did the interview well, then I got the job. Over time I learned that there are tricks that work better.

### The trick to winning interviews.

I'm going to let you in on a little secret that helped me win interview, after interview and knock down clients left and right.

**It's the pitch deck.**

![](/assets/pitch_deck_template.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">The Pitch Deck</p>

A pitch deck is a short slide deck that conveys the business problem, the solution, and why they should hire you to solve the problem.

There's an art to creating the perfect pitch, and what I want to do is give you some shortcuts. So what I'm going to do is expand on the pitch deck on [my course launch + career training event.](https://learn.business-science.io/30day-data-scientist-course-waitlist-1393)  I'll cover how to gather information for the pitch deck and how to present it during the interview so it **distinguishes you from your competition.** Trust me, no one is doing this.

### Does the pitch deck work?

One of my students landed a Senior Data Scientist position at a global airline company in under 4-months.

The pitch deck was essential to passing her take-home project. The interviewers asked her if she previously worked in the airline industry. She did not. The pitch deck, her research, and how she conveyed herself as the solution to their problems was the key.

OK, so onto the fifth and final mistake you are most likely making.

# 5. You talked too much about data science

You're probably thinking, I'm going to go in there and wow them with data science. While data science is very important, it's not actually what businesses want.

What they really want is to understand how you are going to help them **unlock Business Value.**

### How to demonstrate business value?

One of my students recently passed her second round of interviews with the Director of Analytics at a company she is interviewing with.

![](/assets/testimonial_bspf.jpg)

### What was the secret?

Using a [Business Framework](https://www.business-science.io/bspf.html) that shows off your ability to think about the business problem, bring in the right people, focus on costs and KPIs (key performance indicators), and measure results.

Here's what she used:
