The `modelStudio` package is a new R package that makes it easy to interactively explain models using state-of-the-art techniques like Shapley Values, Break Down plots, and Partial Dependence. I was **_shocked_** at how quickly I could get up and running.  In the **next 10-minutes**, we'll learn how to make my **4 most important Explainable AI plots**:

* Plot 1: Feature Importance
* Plot 2: Break Down Plot
* Plot 3: Shapley Values
* Plot 4: Partial Dependence
* **BONUS:** I'll not only show you how to make the plots, but I'll explain exactly **how to read them to generate business insights!**
