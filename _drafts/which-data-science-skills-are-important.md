In late September 2021, David was a Research Analyst with Texas A&M University.

In March of 2022, less than 6-months later, he has accepted a position with Microsoft as a Machine Learning Support Engineer. In one of my webinars, David explained that he had just increased his salary by $50,000.

I told him that's just the beginning.

How was David able to get a job at an elite company like Microsoft?

What skills was David learning that he could transition so quickly?

The rest of this post will show you how David did it. This post includes 4 case studies, research and 2 surveys all to answer questions like...

* What skills separate data scientists like David from everyone else
* How to pick a language (and your choice may surprise you)
* How to pick a development environment
* How to learn the skills
* Why this approach to learning skills works (based on examining 4 case studies)

# Why you should learn these skills

If you want to become a data scientist, you'll need to learn how to generate value for your organizations. I've written about [how data scientists create value for organizations here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/05/23/how-to-become-a-fiancial-data-scientist.html). But, in general, you complete a process (called the data science process), which involves learning these skills.

Data scientists that learn these skills can convince employers to hire them. And that's really important. Here's why. 

According to Glassdoor, learning these data science skills [can have this effect on your salary](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/pittsburgh-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,10_IM684_KO11,25.htm?clickSource=searchBtn) (if you live in Pittsburgh PA like I do, I encourage you to check your own locale).

But that's just the start. 

Like I told David, your career will accelerate. 

Here's what the career path looks like for a [Senior data scientist in Pittsburgh PA](https://www.glassdoor.com/Career/senior-data-scientist-career_KO0,21.htm).

Now I know what you're thinking: _"That salary is great. BUT, I'll never be able to master this list of skills. Especially not in 6-months."_

Actually you can. 

Here's how.  

# How to master learning data science

Mastering data science isn't hard. It just requires:

* Motivation: You'll need to dedicate about 10-hours per week 
* A plan: You'll learn from David and several others in this 

# 1. Pick a language

Who do you think is going to win this battle?

Well it's neither.

Because C++ is the true superior programming language.

I'm just kidding. 

But in truth, it actually doesn't matter. You can succeed with both. 

I know both. 

I teach both. 

But, if we want to really answer this question, we should tackle this like data scientists. You know, with data to support our decision.

So, let's tackle this like data scientists. 

## How to pick a language

If I were picking a language for the first time, I would consider a few things:

1. How useful is the language for data science
2. The demand for the job market
3. The competition in the job market
4. How quickly I can master the language and become skilled labor
5. The difficulty of the language

## 1.1 How useful is the language for data science?

So if you look at [the history of python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/history-of-python/#:\~:text=Python%20is%20a%20widely%20used,in%20fewer%20lines%20of%20code.), it clearly says it is a general purpose, high level programming language. It has an emphasis on code readability and to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

Meanwhile if you look at R, it was closely modeled on the S language for statistical computing and graphics.
