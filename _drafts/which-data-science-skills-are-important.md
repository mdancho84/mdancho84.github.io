In late September 2021, David was a Research Analyst with Texas A&M University.

In March of 2022, less than 6-months later, he has accepted a position with Microsoft as a Machine Learning Support Engineer. In one of my webinars, David explained that he had just increased his salary by $50,000.

I told him that's just the beginning.

How was David able to get a job at an elite company like Microsoft?

What skills was David learning that he could transition so quickly?

The rest of this post will show you how David did it. This post includes 4 case studies, research and 2 surveys all to answer questions like...

* What skills separate data scientists like David from everyone else
* Why picking R or Python matters (and the choice depends on where you are coming from)
* Which tools exist (and which will help you become a data science in under 6-months)
* Why this approach to learning skills works (based on examining 4 case studies)

# Why you should learn these skills

If you want to become a data scientist, you'll need to learn how to generate value for your organizations. I've written about [how data scientists create value for organizations here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/05/23/how-to-become-a-fiancial-data-scientist.html). But, in general, you complete a process (called the data science process), which involves the following plan with skills you need to learn to cover the plan.
