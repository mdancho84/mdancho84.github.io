# `modelDown` Tutorial

Let's dive into using `modelDown` so we can **automate explainable AI**.

**Important:** All of the data and code shown can be accessed through our Business Science [**R-Tips Project**](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter).

**Warning:** This is an advanced tutorial that will depend on knowledge of `tidymodels`. And, it may be uncomfortable if you are a _complete beginner_. BUT, I'll explain how you can learn R, tidymodels, and data science for business from scratch at the end of this tutorial.

Plus I have a **surprise** at the end (for everyone)!

## ðŸ’¡ Step 1: Load the Libraries and Data

### First, run this code to **load the R libraries:**

Load `tidyverse` , `janitor`,  `tidymodels`, `DALEX` and `modelDown`. I'll explain the importance of each of these R packages as we use them.

![](/assets/modeldown_01_libraries.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

### Next, run this code to **pull in the data**.

We'll read in the Customer Churn data set that was used in the previous R-Tip on Survival Analysis.

![](/assets/modeldown_02_data.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the Data.</a> </p>

[**Our data**](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter) looks like this.

![](/assets/modeldown_03_churn_data.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'>The customer churn dataset</p>

We want to understand how customer churn data (Yes/No) depends on other factors like how long they have been a customer and what type of subscription plan they have (monthly, one-year, two-year).

## ðŸ’¡ Step 2: Make a tidymodel

Next, it's time to make a `tidymodel`. This can be a bit challenging for beginners (and even experienced R users, so at the end of this tutorial I'll give you some more help).

**If you are less experienced**, I recommend to just go with it (but then check out the guidance at the end of the training). I'll explain a lot about tidymodels through the process too.

### Recipes: Feature Engineering and Preprocessing

We'll start by getting our data into a format that the models can handle. Run this code to remove unnecessary columns "customer_id" and to one-hot encode any categorical predictors (e.g. "contract" and "gender").

![](/assets/modeldown_04_recipe.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

The preprocessing recipe is just **a template (often called a pipeline)** that takes incoming data and processes it into the "right" format for our models to learn from it.

### Here's the preprocessing effect.

**Before preprocessing** we have predictors like "contract" containing factors (categories) and unnecessary columns like "customer_id" that won't help us predict.

![](/assets/modeldown_05a_before.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'>Before Preprocessing</p>

**And after preprocessing**, our data changes into a format where predictors have been one-hot encoded and unnecessary columns have been removed. This format is much better for machine learning algorithms.

![](/assets/modeldown_05b_after.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'>After Preprocessing</p>

### Machine Learning with Tidymodels

Next, let's create a Random Forest model (Machine Learning). Random Forest models are usually accurate but suffer from being **"Black Box"**, a term that simply means not easy to explain.

Run this code.

![](/assets/modeldown_06_random_forest-1.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

We now have a **model specification**. A common beginner mistake is thinking a model specification is a trained model. The model specification is NOT a trained model. Rather, it's a template to create a model.

We'll train the model next.

### Train the Model

**We have the two ingredients to train a model:** A preprocessing recipe specification and a model specification. Next, we combine them and train them on the unprocessed dataset.

**Key Concept: The Tidymodels Workflow.** Combining the model, recipe, and training is called creating a "tidymodels workflow". The tidymodels workflow is the object that can then be saved, loaded, and used to make predictions.

**Important:** I'm skipping some key steps like cross-validation for the sake of simplifying this tutorial. But, if you need to learn these key steps, then I will give you some free advice at the end of this tutorial.

Run this code to train the model.

![](/assets/modeldown_07_workflow.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

We can test the fitted model by making some predictions. Run this code.

![](/assets/modeldown_08a_predict.jpg)

Here's the result. A bunch of Yes/No's. **This is what we call "Class Predictions".** The algorithm is actually assigning "class" or category to the churn prediction.

![](/assets/modeldown_08a_predict_result.jpg)

### Avoid THIS big mistake (the class probability trick)

**Problem: the Explainable AI algorithm can't use Class Predictions.** It needs "Class Probabilities", or actual numeric values from 0 to 1 that indicate the algorithms estimate of being a Yes.

**THIS was a big mistake that cost me about an hour of headache** when making this tutorial for you. So hopefully showing you the **"Class Probability Trick"** helps save you some time.

Run this code to get class probabilities.

![](/assets/modeldown_08b_predict_proba_2.jpg)

**Solution: the Explainable AI algorithm can use the Class Probabilities.** We now have values from 0-1 for Churn=Yes.

Here's the result. Instead of Yes/Nos we get the algorithm's probability of churn being a yes or a no.

![](/assets/modeldown_08b_predict_proba_result.jpg)

OK, now that we have a way to get class probabilities, now we can make our "Black-Box" model explainable. Let's see how.

## ðŸ’¡ Step 3: Apply Explainable AI

With a model in hand that predicts, we are now ready to explain the model. There's a trick you need to learn.

### The cheat-code for explainable AI

Here's a quick hack to make your models explainable. We will use the `DALEX` package, but we need to **make a custom prediction function**, first.

**A "custom prediction function"** is just a simple function that takes a model and data and retrieves the class probability predictions in the format that the DALEX package needs.

Run this code to make a custom explainer function.

![](/assets/modeldown_09_custom_explainer-1.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

**We can test our custom prediction function** using our trained `tidymodels` workflow. By running on the head (first 6 rows of our dataset), I can truncate to the first 6 predictions. Looks like it's working.

![](/assets/modeldown_10_test_custom_explainer-1.jpg)

### Explain ANY black-box model with `DALEX`

With the cheat code in hand (aka our custom prediction function), I can put all of the pieces together to make an explainer with an amazing R package called `DALEX`.

**What is a DALEX explainer?** Think of it like the precursor to understanding your Black-Box model.  A "DALEX Explainer" is just an object that connects the model, data, prediction function, to a series of algorithms designed to interpret the model and develop explanations.

Run this code to make a DALEX Explainer.

![](/assets/modeldown_11_dalex_explainer.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

### BIG Mistake: Don't forget to check your explainer

**Here's how to check your explainer was set up correctly.** Look at the DALEX explainer output.

![](/assets/modeldown_12_dalex_explainer_output.jpg)

I can see from the output that the explainer has been "initialized" and that several calculations have completed including making predicted values and residuals.

**Important: If the explainer is not set up correctly, you'll get _warnings_ in this stage.** When creating this tutorial (before fixing my prediction function), I had a bunch of warnings indicating my residuals weren't calculated. I just had to go back and change my custom prediction function to set up class probabilities (shown in Step 2 above).

### Create the Automated `modelDown` Website

Once you create a `DALEX` explainer, the beauty is that the ecosystem of [DrWhy Explainable AI packages can all use DALEX explainers](https://modeloriented.github.io/DrWhy/). Here's a snapshot of the DrWhy DALEXverse.

Run this code to create the automated `modelDown` website.

![](/assets/modeldown_13_modeldown.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

This creates a folder containing a deployable website with the automated explainable model report.

# ðŸ’¡ BONUS: Understand the Explainable AI Visualizations!

**Here's the next problem you're going to face.** The Model Down website is great! BUT, you need to know how to interpret the findings (AND uncover business insights).

I want to help. Here's how to interpret and find business insights.

### Step 1: The Variable (Feature) Importance Plot

**First, head to the "Variable Importance" Tab.** You will find a plot called "Feature Importance". This is how we know which features to invest time into.

**Important: I ALWAYS use the Feature Importance Plot first.** This tells me which features I need to focus my time and attention on.

![](/assets/modeldown_14_var_imp_plot.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> Variable (Feature Importance) </p>

**The feature importance plot** is quite simply a visualization that identifies the top features in your modelDown report. I can see that "contract" and "tenure" are my top 2 features.

### Step 2: The Variable Response Plots

Now that we know WHICH features are important, I head over to the "Variable Response" tab. This is where I gain my Business Insights.

**Warning:** If you skip Step 1, you'll waste time investigating bad features. So make sure you do Step 1 first.

#### Business Insight #1: Contract Type

From Step 1, I saw that "contract" was the most important. On the Variable Response Tab, I select "contract", which leads me to my first Business Insight.

![](/assets/modeldown_15_feature_contract.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> Inspecting the Top Feature (Most Important) </p>

I can quickly see that Month-to-Month contracts have increased churn probability according to my Random Forest Model.

**Business Insight #1:** To reduce churn, we could try giving customers incentivized offers to upgrade to longer-term contracts like one-year or two-year.

#### Business Insight #2: Tenure

In Step 1 above, I also saw that "tenure" was an important feature. On the Variable Response Tab, I select "tenure", and this leads me to my second Business Insight.

![](/assets/modeldown_16_feature_tenure.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> Inspecting the 2nd Most Important Feature </p>

I can see that when tenure is low (less than 6-months), that customers have a much higher churn probability according to my Random Forest Model.

**Business Insight #2:** To reduce churn, we could try rewarding customer loyalty to stay beyond 6-months (Example promotion: "_Try for 6-months and the 7th is on us!"_).

# ðŸ’¡ Conclusions
