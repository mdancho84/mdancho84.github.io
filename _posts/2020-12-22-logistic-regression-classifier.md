This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

<br/>

Logistic regression is a simple, yet powerful classification model. In this  tutorial, learn how to build a predictive classifier that classifies the age of a vehicle. Then use `ggplot` to tell the story! 

Here are the links to get set up. üëá

## The Story

In this analysis we learn that newer vehicles are MORE EFFICIENT, and we'll make a data visualization that tells the story.

## How did we make this plot?

1. Our logistic regression classifier modeled the data
2. We used `VIP` to find the most important features
3. We visualized with ggplot üí•



## Making a Logistic Regression Classifier

Logistic regression is a must-know tool in your data science arsenal. 

- Logistic Regression is **easy to explain**
- The classifier has no tuning parameters (**no knobs that need adjusted**)

Simply split our dataset, train on the training set, evaluate on the testing set.

Folks, it's that simple. üëè

## Evaluating Our Classification Model

_Question:_ How do we know our if our model is good? <br>
_Answer:_ Area Under the Curve (AUC)!

#### About AUC:

- Simple measure.
- We want greater than 0.5.
- Closer to 1.0, the better our model is. 
- Bonus: **ROC Plot - A way to visualize the AUC.**

## Telling the Story

What can we do with a Logistic Regression Classifier? Let's **develop a story to communicate our insight**!

<br>

**1.** First, find the most important features (predictors) using `vip()`.

<br>

<br>

**2.** Next, use `ggplot()` to make a visualization that focuses on the top features:
- _HWY_: The highway fuel economy (miles per gallon)
- _CLASS_: The Vehicle Class (e.g. pickup, subcompact, SUV)

### What did we learn using Logistic Regression?

It's clear now:
- Vehicles have become more efficient over time. 
- Highway fuel economy has gone up for every single class of vehicle.
