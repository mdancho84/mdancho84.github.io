In this tutorial, we'll show how we used `clean_anomalies()` from the `anomalize` package to ___reduce forecast error by 9%.___ 

__R Packages Covered__:

- `anomalize` - Time series anomaly detection

## Cleaning Anomalies to Reduce Forecast Error by 9%

We can often improve forecast performance by cleaning anomalous data prior to forecasting. This is the perfect use case for integrating the `clean_anomalies()` function from `anomalize` into your ___forecast workflow___. 

## Forecast Workflow

![Forecast With Anomalize](/assets/2019-09-30-anomalize/forecast_with_anomalize_md.jpg)

We'll use the following workflow to remove time series anomalies prior to forecasting.

1. __Identify the anomalies__ - Decompose the time series with `time_decompose()` and `anomalize()` the remainder (residuals)

2. __Clean the anomalies__ - Use the new `clean_anomalies()` function to reconstruct the time series, replacing anomalies with the trend and seasonal components

3. __Forecast__ - Use a forecasting algorithm to predict new observations from a training set, then compare to test set with and without anomalies cleaned

### Step 1 - Load Libraries

First, load the following libraries to follow along. 


{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)  # Core data manipulation and visualization libraries
library(tidyquant)  # Used for business-ready ggplot themes
library(anomalize)  # Identify and clean time series anomalies
library(timetk)     # Time Series Machine Learning Features
library(knitr)      # For kable() function
{% endhighlight %}


### Step 2 - Get the Data

This tutorial uses the `tidyverse_cran_downloads` dataset that comes with `anomalize`. These are the historical downloads of several "tidy" R packages from 2017-01-01 to 2018-03-01.

Let's take one package with some extreme events. We'll hone in on `lubridate` (but you could pick any). 


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    time_decompose(count) %>%
    anomalize(remainder) %>%
    time_recompose() %>%
    plot_anomalies(ncol = 3, alpha_dots = 0.3)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](/figure/source/2019-09-30-anomalize-improve-forecast/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

We'll `filter()` downloads of the `lubridate` R package. 


{% highlight r %}
lubridate_tbl <- tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(package == "lubridate")
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a visual representation of the forecast experiment setup. Training data will be any data before "2018-01-01".

## Step 3 - Workflow for Cleaning Anomalies 

The workflow to clean anomalies:

1. We decompose the "counts" column using `time_decompose()` - This returns a Seasonal-Trend-Loess (STL) Decomposition in the form of "observed", "season", "trend" and "remainder".

2. We fix any negative values - If present, they can throw off forecasting transformations (e.g. log and power transformations)

3. We identifying anomalies (`anomalize()`) on the "remainder" column - Returns "remainder_l1" (lower limit), "remainder_l2" (upper limit), and "anomaly" (Yes/No).

4. We use the function, __`clean_anomalies()`__, to add new column called "observed_cleaned" that ___repairs the anomalous data___ by replacing all anomalies with the trend + seasonal components from the decompose operation. 




{% highlight r %}
lubridate_anomalized_tbl <- lubridate_tbl %>%
    
    # 1. Decompose download counts and anomalize the STL decomposition remainder
    time_decompose(count) %>%
    
    # 2. Fix negative values if any in observed
    mutate(observed = ifelse(observed < 0, 0, observed)) %>%
    
    # 3. Identify anomalies
    anomalize(remainder) %>%
  
    # 4. Clean & repair anomalous data
    clean_anomalies()

# Show change in observed vs observed_cleaned
lubridate_anomalized_tbl %>% 
  filter(anomaly == "Yes") %>%
  select(date, anomaly, observed, observed_cleaned) %>%
  head() %>% 
  kable()
{% endhighlight %}



|date       |anomaly | observed| observed_cleaned|
|:----------|:-------|--------:|----------------:|
|2017-01-12 |Yes     |        0|         3522.194|
|2017-04-19 |Yes     |     8549|         5201.716|
|2017-09-01 |Yes     |        0|         4136.721|
|2017-09-07 |Yes     |     9491|         4871.176|
|2017-10-30 |Yes     |    11970|         6412.571|
|2017-11-13 |Yes     |    10267|         6640.871|

Here's a visual of the "observed" (uncleaned) vs the "observed_cleaned" (cleaned) training sets. We'll see what influence these anomalies have on a forecast regression (next).

## Step 4 - Forecasting Downloads of the Lubridate Package

First, we'll make a function, `forecast_downloads()`, that can take the input of both cleaned and uncleaned anomalies and return the forecasted downloads versus actual downloads. The modeling function is described in the [Appendix - Forecast Downloads Function](#appendix).







### Step 4.1 - Before Cleaning with anomalize

We'll first perform a forecast without cleaning anomalies (high leverage points). 

- The `forecast_downloads()` function trains on the "observed" (uncleaned) data and returns predictions versus actual. 
- Internally, a power transformation (square-root) is applied to improve the forecast due to the multiplicative properties. 
- The model uses a linear regression of the form `sqrt(observed) ~ numeric index + year + quarter + month + day of week`.


{% highlight r %}
lubridate_forecast_with_anomalies_tbl <- lubridate_anomalized_tbl %>%
  
    # See Apendix - Forecast Downloads Function
    forecast_downloads(
        col_train = observed,     # First train with anomalies included
        sep       = "2018-01-01", # Separate at 1st of year
        trans     = "sqrt"        # Perform sqrt() transformation
    )
{% endhighlight %}

#### Forecast vs Actual Values

The forecast is overplotted against the actual values.  


![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](/figure/source/2019-09-30-anomalize-improve-forecast/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

We can see that the forecast is shifted vertically, an effect of the high leverage points.

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10](/figure/source/2019-09-30-anomalize-improve-forecast/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

#### Forecast Error Calculation

___The mean absolute error (MAE) is 1570___, meaning on average the forecast is off by 1570 downloads each day.


{% highlight r %}
lubridate_forecast_with_anomalies_tbl %>%
    summarise(mae = mean(abs(prediction - actual)))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##     mae
##   <dbl>
## 1 1570.
{% endhighlight %}


### Step 4.2 - After Cleaning with anomalize

We'll next perform a forecast this time using the repaired data from `clean_anomalies()`. 

- The `forecast_downloads()` function trains on the "observed_cleaned" (cleaned) data and returns predictions versus actual. 
- Internally, a power transformation (square-root) is applied to improve the forecast due to the multiplicative properties. 
- The model uses a linear regression of the form `sqrt(observed_cleaned) ~ numeric index + year + quarter + month + day of week`


{% highlight r %}
lubridate_forecast_without_anomalies_tbl <- lubridate_anomalized_tbl %>%
    
    # See Appendix - Forecast Downloads Function
    forecast_downloads(
        col_train = observed_cleaned, # Forecast with cleaned anomalies
        sep       = "2018-01-01",     # Separate at 1st of year
        trans     = "sqrt"            # Perform sqrt() transformation
    )
{% endhighlight %}

#### Forecast vs Actual Values

The forecast is overplotted against the actual values. The cleaned data is shown in Yellow. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13](/figure/source/2019-09-30-anomalize-improve-forecast/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

Zooming in on the forecast region, we can see that the forecast does a better job following the trend in the test data. 

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14](/figure/source/2019-09-30-anomalize-improve-forecast/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

#### Forecast Error Calculation

___The mean absolute error (MAE) is 1435___, meaning on average the forecast is off by 1435 downloads each day.


{% highlight r %}
lubridate_forecast_without_anomalies_tbl %>%
    summarise(mae = mean(abs(prediction - actual)))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 1 x 1
##     mae
##   <dbl>
## 1 1435.
{% endhighlight %}


## 8.6% Reduction in Forecast Error

Using the new `anomalize` function, `clean_anomalies()`, prior to forecasting results in an __8.6% reduction in forecast error__ as measure by Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 


{% highlight r %}
((1435 - 1570) / 1570)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] -0.08598726
{% endhighlight %}


# Conclusion

Forecasting with clean anomalies is a good practice that can provide __substantial improvement to forecasting accuracy by removing high leverage points__. The new `clean_anomalies()` function in the `anomalize` package provides an easy workflow for removing anomalies prior to forecasting.

# Appendix - Forecast Downloads Function {#appendix}

The `forecast_downloads()` function uses the following procedure:

- Split the `data` into training and testing data using a date specified using the `sep` argument.
- Apply a statistical transformation: none, log-1-plus (`log1p()`), or power (`sqrt()`)
- Model the daily time series of the training data set from observed (demonstrates no cleaning) or observed and cleaned (demonstrates improvement from cleaning). Specified by the `col_train` argument. 
- Compares the predictions to the observed values. 



{% highlight r %}
forecast_downloads <- function(data, col_train,

    predict_expr <- enquo(col_train)
    trans <- trans[1]
    
    # Spit into training/testing sets
    train_tbl <- data %>% filter(date < ymd(sep))
    test_tbl  <- data %>% filter(date >= ymd(sep))
    
    # Apply Transformation
    pred_form <- quo_name(predict_expr)
    if (trans != "none") pred_form <- str_glue("{trans}({pred_form})")
    
    # Make the model formula
    model_formula <- str_glue("{pred_form} ~ index.num + half
