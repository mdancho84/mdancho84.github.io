My new package, `tidyquant`, is now available on CRAN. `tidyquant` integrates the best quantitative resources for collecting and analyzing quantitative data, `xts`, `quantmod` and `TTR`, with the tidy data infrastructure of the `tidyverse` allowing for seamless interaction between each. While this post aims to introduce `tidyquant` to the _R community_, it just scratches the surface of the features and benefits. We'll go through a simple stock visualization using `ggplot2`, which which shows off the integration. The package is open source, and you can view the code on the [tidyquant github page](https://github.com/mdancho84/tidyquant).

# Updates <a class="anchor" id="updates"></a>

* _2017-01-17_: I updated the post to use the 0.2.0 `tq_mutate` and `tq_transform` function arguments `ohlc_fun`, `x`, and `y` (replaces `x_fun`, `.x` and `.y`, respectively). These will be deprecated in 0.3.0 so please make the switch! :)

# Why tidyquant? <a class="anchor" id="why"></a>

One of the reasons why I began my journey into _R programming_ is because it's the best open-source option for stock analysis. With quantitative financial analysis (QFA) packages like `quantmod`, `xts` and `TTR`, stock data can quickly be retrieved, sliced and diced, transformed and mutated, and visualized so I can make investment decisions. It's really a beautiful thing.  

Over time, the _R programming_ landscape has evolved. A major step forward was the `tidyverse`, a collection of _R packages_ that work in harmony, are built for scale-ability, and are well documented in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). However, a problem has surfaced: the QFA packages are not easy to use with the `tidyverse`. The `tidyverse` works with data frames while the QFA packages work with extensible time-series (`xts`) objects. Both are great, but they don't easily work together.

As you can imagine, my workflow was longer than I'd like. I'd work in `xts` to use various functions to calculate moving averages, moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, etc, and then convert to tibbles (tidy dataframes) for mapping functions with `purrr` to scale to many stocks, for mutating dataframes with `dplyr` to add new columns, and for visualizing my analysis using `ggplot2`. This got very long and repetitive...  

Enter `tidyquant`. The package started off as a collection of scripts aimed at increasing my efficiency and performance of my stock analyses: 

  * I would start by getting data with `tq_get()`, which returns data, such as stock prices or financial statements, as a `tibble` object. 
  * I'd use `tq_transform()` to use the various `quantmod` and `xts` functions that can change periodicities, such as period returns and conversion from daily to monthly periodicity. 
  * I'd use `tq_mutate()` to seamlessly apply the various `TTR` functions, such as moving averages, MACD's, Bollinger Bands, etc.  
  * And, I'd do all of this without ever leaving the `tidyverse`, which allowed me to mutate, pipe (`%>%`),  and scale my analyses at ease.

In this evolution and in the spirit of open source, I have released the `tidyquant` package to the _R community_ with the hope that others can benefit from the integration between the QFA packages (`quantmod`, `xts`, and `TTR`) and the `tidyverse`. I believe this is the right way to go, and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback. 

# Benefits <a class="anchor" id="benefits"></a>

__The `tidyquant` philosophy:__

* __A few core functions with a lot of power, that__
* __leverage the quantitative analysis power of `xts`, `quantmod` and `TTR`, and are__
* __designed to be used and scaled with the `tidyverse`.__

# Example: Visualizing Moving Averages <a class="anchor" id="example"></a>

I'll go through an example of visualizing the 15-day and 50-day moving averages of the stock symbol, _AAPL_, which is for Apple Inc. Moving averages are a popular trading tool that stock analysts use to determine buying and selling signals. According to [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp), the moving average is...

> A widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the “noise” from random price fluctuations. A moving average (MA) is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it is based on past prices. The two basic and commonly used MAs are the simple moving average (SMA), which is the simple average of a security over a defined number of time periods, and the exponential moving average (EMA), which gives bigger weight to more recent prices. The most common applications of MAs are to identify the trend direction and to determine support and resistance levels. While MAs are useful enough on their own, they also form the basis for other indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

Of particular interest is the crossover, the point at which a trend begins to emerge, which can be used as a buy or sell signal.

Let's go through an example to visualize the 15-day and 50-day moving averages for _AAPL_.

## Step 1: Prerequisites <a class="anchor" id="step1"></a>

The `tidyquant` package can be downloaded from CRAN:


{% highlight r %}
install.packages("tidyquant")
{% endhighlight %}

For those following along in _R_, you'll need to load the following package:


{% highlight r %}
# Loads tidyquant, tidyverse, lubridate, quantmod, TTR, and xts
library(tidyquant)
{% endhighlight %}

I also recommend the open-source [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE, which makes _R Programming_ easy and efficient.

## Step 2: Use tq_get to get stock prices <a class="anchor" id="step2"></a>

We'll start by getting the last year of stock prices. We use the tidyquant `tq_get()` function for all data retrieval. Set the parameter `get = "stock.prices"` to tell tidyquant we want the historical stock prices. We can use the `from` argument to pass a date as the start of the collection, which accepts character string in the form of "YYYY-MM-DD". We can use `lubridate` functions `today()` and `years()` to get the date from one year ago.


{% highlight r %}
from <- today() - years(1)
AAPL <- tq_get("AAPL", get = "stock.prices", from = from)
AAPL
{% endhighlight %}

We now have 251 days of stock prices as a `tibble` object. This is exactly the format we want for working in the `tidyverse`. 

## Step 3: Use tq_mutate to add moving averages <a class="anchor" id="step3"></a>

We need to get the 15-day and 50-day moving averages. We want to use the `SMA()` function from the `TTR` package. To use any of these functions in the `tidyverse`, we have a few options with pros and cons: 

* `dplyr::mutate()`: Used to add a single column to a data set. Only able to add a single column to a tibble. For `SMA()`, this works because a single column is generated. For other functions such as `BBands()` and `MACD`, multiple columns are generated that fail on `mutate()`.

* `tidyquant::tq_mutate()`: Used to add single or multiple columns to a data set. Uses `quantmod` OHLC notation (more on this in a minute). The output generated must be the number of rows as the input dataframe (otherwise the data can't be joined). Because multiple columns can be returned, works with `BBands()` and `MACD()`.

* `tidyquant::tq_transform()`: Used to return a new data set with output only (does not return the input dataframe). Uses OHLC notation. Most flexible option.

* `tidyquant::tq_mutate_xy()`: Same as `tq_mutate()` but works using up to two column inputs instead of OHLC notation.

* `tidyquant::tq_transform_xy()`: Same as `tq_transform()` but works using up to two column inputs instead of OHLC notation.

For this tutorial, we will use `tq_mutate()` to expose you to OHLC notation along with the `tidyquant` function workflow. We'll also show `tq_mutate_xy()` so you can see the difference in arguments.

### tq_mutate() function

`tq_mutate()` has two primary arguments: `ohlc_fun` and `mutate_fun`: 

* `ohlc_fun`: Takes `quantmod::OHLC` functions, which are `Op`, `Cl`, `Hi`, `Lo`, `Vo`, `Ad`, `HLC`, `OHLC`, and `OHLCV`. The OHLC notation is the basis of all `quantmod`, `xts`, and `TTR` functions. These functions collect a subset of the dataframe columns matching open, high, low, close, volume, and/or adjusted. Think of the OHLC notation akin to the `dplyr::select()` function, which selects columns. `Op` selects the column named "open", and `HLC` selects "high", "low" and "close" columns.

* `mutate_fun`: Takes any `quantmod`, `xts`, or `TTR` function listed in `tq_mutate_fun_options()` (see below for compatible functions). The `mutation_fun` performs the work. Any additional parameters of the passed via `...` in the `tq_mutate()` function go to the `mutation_fun`.  


{% highlight r %}
# Get list of tq_mutate() options
tq_mutate_fun_options() %>% 
    str() # str() to minimize output. Remove str() to see full output.
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## List of 4
##  $ zoo     : chr [1:14] "rollapply" "rollapplyr" "rollmax" "rollmax.default" ...
##  $ xts     : chr [1:27] "apply.daily" "apply.monthly" "apply.quarterly" "apply.weekly" ...
##  $ quantmod: chr [1:25] "allReturns" "annualReturn" "ClCl" "dailyReturn" ...
##  $ TTR     : chr [1:61] "adjRatios" "ADX" "ALMA" "aroon" ...
{% endhighlight %}

An example with `SMA()` from the `TTR` package helps solidify how it works. Reviewing the documentation for `SMA`, we see that the function, `SMA(x, n = 10, ...)`, accepts `x` a price or volume and `n` a number of periods to average over. For the 15-day simple moving average, we would pass a set of prices, either "close" or "adjusted", and `n = 15` for 15 days. In OHLC notation `ohlc_fun = Cl` for "close" or `ohlc_fun = Ad` for adjusted. The `mutate_fun = SMA`, and we pass `n = 15` as an additional argument. Shown below, we pipe (`%>%`) our tibble of AAPL stock prices to `tq_mutate(ohlc_fun = Cl, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 15)`, which creates an additional column with the simple moving average of the close prices. 


{% highlight r %}
AAPL %>%
    tq_mutate(ohlc_fun = Cl, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 15)
{% endhighlight %}

We need both the 15-day and the 50-day moving average, which is two steps with the pipe. I `rename` in between steps so the column names are more descriptive.

### tq_mutate_xy() function

Not all `quantmod`, `xts`, and `TTR` functions work with OHLC notation. A few of these functions take two primary inputs. An example of this is the `Delt` function from the `quantmod` package. The function form is `Delt(x1, x2 = NULL, k = 0, type = c("arithmetic", "log"))`, which has `x1` and `x2` arguments. In these situations you will need to use the XY variant, `tq_mutate_xy()`, which accepts `x` (required) and `y` (optional).  For the `Delt` function, `x = x1` and `y = x2`.

For the `SMA()` function, we don't need the `y` argument, but we can use the XY variant to accomplish the same task as the OHLC variant. The operation is the same except instead of `ohlc_fun = Cl` we replace with `x = close` (the name of the column being passed to the mutation function).


{% highlight r %}
AAPL %>%
    tq_mutate_xy(x = close, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 15) %>%
    rename(SMA.15 = SMA) %>%
    tq_mutate_xy(x = close, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 50) %>%
    rename(SMA.50 = SMA)
{% endhighlight %}

{% endhighlight %}

### Back to the example

Returning back to our need, we get the simple moving averages using one of the the code options mentioned previously.


{% highlight r %}
AAPL <- AAPL %>%
    tq_mutate(ohlc_fun = Cl, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 15) %>%
    rename(SMA.15 = SMA) %>%
    tq_mutate(ohlc_fun = Cl, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 50) %>%
    rename(SMA.50 = SMA)
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 4: Visualize the Simple Moving Averages <a class="anchor" id="step4"></a>

We have our 15-day and 50-day simple moving averages. Now all we need to do is visualize using `ggplot2`. The format of the data will need to be tidy, which requires us to use `gather()` from the `tidyr` package to shift the close, SMA.15, and SMA.50 columns into a long form with type and price. The code and final data form is shown below.



{% highlight r %}
AAPL %>%
    select(date, close, SMA.15, SMA.50) %>%
    gather(key = type, value = price, close:SMA.50)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 753 × 3
##          date  type  price
##        <date> <chr>  <dbl>
## 1  2016-01-19 close  96.66
## 2  2016-01-20 close  96.79
## 3  2016-01-21 close  96.30
## 4  2016-01-22 close 101.42
## 5  2016-01-25 close  99.44
## 6  2016-01-26 close  99.99
## 7  2016-01-27 close  93.42
## 8  2016-01-28 close  94.09
## 9  2016-01-29 close  97.34
## 10 2016-02-01 close  96.43
## # ... with 743 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we can use `ggplot2` to plot the tidy data. We use the same select and gather statements above and pipe to `ggplot`. I add a custom palette to match the black, blue and red colors from the Investopedia graphic. The final code chunk for the visualization is as follows: 


{% highlight r %}
my_palette <- c("black", "blue", "red")
AAPL %>%
    select(date, close, SMA.15, SMA.50) %>%
    gather(key = type, value = price, close:SMA.50) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price, col = type)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_colour_manual(values = my_palette) + 
    theme(legend.position="bottom") +
    ggtitle("Simple Moving Averages are a Breeze with tidyquant") +
    xlab("") + 
    ylab("Stock Price")
{% endhighlight %}

# Conclusion <a class="anchor" id="conclusion"></a>

The `tidyquant` package integrates the three primary QFA packages, `quantmod`, `xts`, and `TTR`, with the `tidyverse`. 
 
# Recap <a class="anchor" id="recap"></a>

The purpose of this post was twofold:

1. Introduce you to the `tidyquant` package
2. Show an example of the integration between the QFA packages and the `tidyverse`.

We discussed why there is a need for `tidyquant`, which is to help minimize the back and forth between `xts` and `tibble` (tidy dataframes). We also went through an example of getting simple moving averages, which previously required jumping back and forth between `xts` and `tibble` objects. The `tidyquant` package made this much easier.

This example just scratches the surface of the power of `tidyquant`. See the vignette for a detailed discussion on each of the `tidyquant` features.
