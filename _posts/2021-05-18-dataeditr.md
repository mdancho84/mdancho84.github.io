# GUI for Editing Dataframes in R <br><small>Edit dataframes as if they were Excel tables.</small>

`DataEditR` is a great addition to the R package ecosystem. I see it being immediately __useful for beginners coming from Excel__ where they are used to being able to edit data interactively in an Excel Worksheet. 

Find out how easy it is to edit data with the __DataEditR GUI (Graphical User Interface).__

## BONUS: 

I have an extra `ggplot2` code showing boxplots of the Fuel Economy at the end of the tutorial (a vision of where you can go once you learn R beyond the GUI).

# Beginners Struggle with R <br><small>Simple tools like DataEditR can make your transition much easier.</small>

__One of my biggest challenges__ when I moved from `Excel` to `R` was the transition from an interactive worksheet where I could edit data using point-click-edit to a data frame that requires code to edit. This was a serious hurdle. I _wish_ I had a tool like `DataEditR` when I was first starting out. 

Fast-forward to 2021, and here we are: `DataEditR`, the GUI I never had. Today, you'll learn how to use this <span style='color:blue;'>Excel-style dataframe editing tool.</span>

# Before we get started, get the R Cheat Sheet

`DataEditR` is great for making simple edits. But, you'll still need to learn how to wrangle data with `dplyr` and visualize data with `ggplot2`. For those topics, I'll use the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) to refer to `dplyr` and `ggplot2` code in my workflow.

### Quick Example:

[Download the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) __Then Click the "CS" next to "ggplot2"__ opens the Data Visualization with GGplot2 Cheat Sheet.

<a href="https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html"> <img src="/assets/2021-05-11-patchwork/workflow.jpg" style='max-width:100%;'>

Now you're ready to quickly reference `ggplot2` functions.

Onto the tutorial.

# How DataEditR works

It's super-simple. Just run this code to:

1. __Load Libraries:__ Load `DataEditR` , `tidyverse` and `tidyquant`. 
2. __Import Data:__ We're using the `mpg` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`. 
3. __Start Data Editing:__ Use the `data_edit()` function.

This launches the __Data Editor.__

## Try Editing Cells

Click on a cell and make any edits.

<p class='text-center date'>Editing Cells</p>

## Try Selecting Columns

Click the target icon. Then select columns you are interested in.

<p class='text-center date'>Selecting Columns</p>


## When you're done, save a CSV

After you've made your edits, you can optionally save a CSV File. Alternatively, you can return a data frame in your active R Session.

<p class='text-center date'>Save as CSV File</p>


## Going Further <br><small>with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`</small>

`DataEditR` is great for making simple edits. But, eventually you're going to need to go further by using code to wrangle data and prepare visualizations. For this, I'll circle back to `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, and my [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html).

### Fuel Economy by Vehicle Model

Say that you wanted to make a visualization that shows the differences in vehicle models and their fuel economy measured as miles per gallon (MPG). We can do this with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`.

</p>

## Visualization and Insights

The code makes a stunning `ggplot2` visualization that highlights the differences in fuel economy by vehicle model and class. We can see:

- __SUV's__ clearly have the lowest fuel economy although the Subaru Forester AWD seems to be an outlier. 
- __Toyota Corolla__ is leading the pack with Highway MPG in the mid-30s.

# In Summary

You've seen how `DataEditR` can be used for making simple edits inside of R. You've also seen that learning `dplyr` and `ggplot2` can generate insights through visualizations. 

What if you want to go further? Read on. 

# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

At the beginning of the article, I talked briefly about __my struggles learning R.__ It took me a long time. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.  I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

If you feel like this, you're not alone.

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught smartly

2. Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated. 

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will __get you past your struggles__ and improve your career in the process. 

It's called the [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 5+ projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment. 

The result is that __you break through previous struggles__, learning from my experience & our community of 2000+ data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
