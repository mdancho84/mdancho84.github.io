## Top 20 Tech Skills 2014-2019

Indeed, the popular employment-related search engine, released an article [showing changing trends from 2014 to 2019 in "Technology-Related Job Postings"](https://www.hiringlab.org/2019/11/19/todays-top-tech-skills/) examining the __5-Year Change of the most requested technology skills.__

</p>

I'm generally not a big fan of these reports because the technology landscape changes so quickly. But, I was pleasantly surprised at the length of time from the analysis - Indeed looked at ___changes over a 5-year period, which gives a much better sense of the long term trends.___ 

## Cloud, Machine Learning, Apps Driving Growth

__3 Technology Trends__ show that organizations are transitioning from Business Reporting to Application Development (Read [5 Data Science Technologies for 2020 (and Beyond)](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/12/09/data-science-technologies.html) for more insights on Key Skills for Data Science and App Development):

1. __Cloud__ - AWS (14% Share, 400% Growth) and Azure (1100% Growth)

2. __Machine Learning__ - Machine Learning (400% Growth), Python (18% Share, 123% Growth)

3. <span style="color:blue;">__Applications__ - Git (8% Share, 150% Growth), Docker (4000% Growth)</span>

The changing business needs is _challenging Data Scientists_ to learn new technologies for __Data Science Application Development... And, `Git` and `Docker` are the future for app development.__ 

## Git & Docker Trends

We can see that both `Git` and `Docker` are experiencing explosive, multi-year growth trends in "Google Search Interest", further supporting the need to learn these key technologies that drive application development. (Read [Docker for Data Science Applications (4000% Growth)](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/11/22/docker-for-data-science.html) to learn about how `Docker` helps facilitate data science applications.)

## What Is Git?

Let's look at a (`Shiny`) web application to see what `Git` does and how it helps.

![Git Workflow](/assets/2019-12-16-git/git_workflow.jpg)

`Git` and `GitHub` facilitate a workflow for developing and deploying applications:

1. Application Development begins locally (__Local Repository__) on your computer. Changes are tracked with `Git`.

2. Code is pushed to `GitHub`, a __Remote Repository__ designed for sharing version controlled files.

3. The remote repository can be cloned to an `AWS EC2 Instance`, which is a __Host__ for the production application. 

## Git Version Control

The most important concept of `git` is version control. Let's dive into the application to see how `git` helps. 

![AWS Application Development with Git and Docker](/assets/2019-12-16-git/application_development.jpg)

We can see that application consists of 2 things:

- __Files (`Git` Control__ - The set of instructions for the app. For a Shiny App this includes an app.R file that contains layout instructions, server control instructions, database instructions, etc

- __Software (`Docker` Control)__ - The code external to your files that your application files depend on. For a Shiny App, this is R, Shiny Server, and any libraries your app uses.


<mark><strong><code>Git</code> applies version control to the files.</strong> This is a lifeline in case you make a change that adversely impacts production. You can always go backwards.</mark>


## Git Commands

__Version Control Status & `Git` Command Workflow.__ When a codebase has `git` initialized, the files are untracked in your Working Directory. As changes are made, the user wants to track these changes. We track them using git commands. 

![Git Commands](/assets/2019-12-16-git/git_commands.png)



Git commands change the status by moving files through the version control workflow. The most important commands are:

- `commit` - This is when a snapshot of the file is added to your local repository. You can always go back to this version.

- `push` - To push any committed files from a local repo (e.g. your computer) to a remote repo (e.g. GitHub)

- `pull` - To pull down files on a remote repository to your local computer

- `reset` - To undo a change to a committed file



## Real Shiny App + AWS + Git Example

In my [Shiny Developer with AWS Course (NEW)](https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/), you use the following application architecture that uses `AWS EC2` to create an `Ubuntu Linux Server` that hosts a `Shiny` App in the cloud called the _Stock Analyzer_.

We use `Git` to track our files as we move into Production. Here's an example of the files stored on GitHub in a Private Repo.

<br><a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/"><small>From Shiny Developer with AWS Course</small></a></p>

You then deploy your "Stock Analyzer" application into Production so it's accessible anywhere via the __AWS Cloud__ via AWS EC2 Instance.
