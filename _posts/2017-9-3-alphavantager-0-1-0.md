We're excited to announce the `alphavantager` package, a lightweight R interface to the Alpha Vantage API! [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) is a __FREE API for retreiving real-time and historical financial data__. It's very easy to use, and, with the recent _glitch_ with the _Yahoo Finance_ API, _Alpha Vantage_ is a solid alternative for retrieving financial data for FREE! It's definitely worth checking out if you are interested in financial analysis. We'll go through the `alphavantager` R interface in this post to show you how easy it is to get __real-time and historical financial data__. In the near future, we have plans to incorporate the `alphavantager` into `tidyquant` to enable scaling from one equity to many.

As always, we are interested in both expanding our _network of data scientists_ and seeking _new clients interested in applying data science to business and finance_.

## Alpha Vantage

Alpha Vantage is a free service that enables users to get real-time and historical equity data. New users will need to visit [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and obtain an API key.

## R Interface: Getting Started

The `alphavantager` package provides a convenient and lightweight interface to the Alpha Vantage API. 

To get started, install the package from CRAN or from GitHub:


{% highlight r %}
install.packages("alphavantager")
# Or
devtools::install_github("business-science/alphavantager")
{% endhighlight %}

Load the package.


{% highlight r %}
library(alphavantager)
{% endhighlight %}

Set your API key (get one from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) if you don't already have one... it's free).


{% highlight r %}
av_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
print(av_api_key())
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] "YOUR_API_KEY"
{% endhighlight %}




## Getting Financial Data from Alpha Vantage

Now, you're ready to get financial data via `av_get()`, which accepts the same<sup>1</sup> arguments as the [API Documentation](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) parameters. The function is setup with two primary arguments, `symbol` and `av_fun`, which accepts an equity and one of the API "function" parameters. You can pass additional API parameters via the `...`.


{% highlight r %}
# Function is streamlined and user adds additional parameters via ... 
args(av_get)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## function (symbol = NULL, av_fun, ...) 
## NULL
{% endhighlight %}

Let's take `av_get()` for a test spin!

#### Time Series Data

We can get __real-time intraday stock data__ by setting `av_fun = "TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY"` and the `interval` to one of the available resolutions ("1min", "5min", "15min", "30min" or "60min"). We can also get daily, daily adjusted, weekly and monthly time series. Note that only 100 rows are returned by default, add the parameter `outputsize = "full"` to get the full number of rows. 


{% highlight r %}
av_get(symbol = "MSFT", av_fun = "TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY", interval = "15min", outputsize = "compact")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}
av_get(symbol = "MSFT", av_fun = "SMA", interval = "monthly", time_period = 60, series_type = "close")
{% endhighlight %}

#### Important Notes: av_get()

For the most part, the `av_get()` function works the same as the [Alpha Vantage API Parameters](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/). However, users will want to understand a few important aspects to the R interface:

1. The `av_fun` argument replaces the API parameter "function" because function is a reserved name in R. All other arguments match the Alpha Vantage API parameters.

2. There is no need to specify the `apikey` parameter as an argument to `av_get()`. The required method is to set the API key using `av_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")`.

3. There is no need to specify the `datatype` parameter as an argument to `av_get()`. The function will return a tibble data frame. 

4. Some data sets only return 100 rows by default. Change the parameter `outputsize = "full"` to get the full dataset.

## Next Steps

We have plans to integrate `alphavantager` into `tidyquant`, which will enable scaling from one equity to many! The change will be incorporated into `tq_get()`, the one-stop shop for getting financial data. It's coming soon!!!
