Becoming a data scientist in Finance can be a lofty challenge... unless you see how to streamline the path. Instead of asking "what skills do I need?", ___we need to ask a different question___. We need to first learn to see ___what the organization values___. Then apply the __80/20 Rule__ to get there. 

This is what you've been waiting for. 

The opportunity to understand what organizations in Finance (or any Domain) value. If you understand what they value, you then know what skills to learn to streamline your path from where you are now to being a productive member of a Financial organization (or any organization).

<p class="text-center date">My Talk "How To Become A Financial Data Scientist" - YouTube</p>

What I'm covering here is focused on finance, but the same strategies can be applied broadly to domains as wide-reaching as Marketing, Research & Development, Medicine, and more. 

But, first, the cold hard reality...

## Learning Skills That You Don't Use Is A Waste Of Time

Most data scientists that want to break into Finance make major mistakes that cost them a career. It starts with their first step.

![Modern Data Scientist](/assets/2019-05-23-financial-data-scientist/modern_data_scientist.jpg)
<p class="text-center date">"Modern Data Scientist Infographic" - Everything That Is Wrong With A Learning Strategy</p>

They see the _"Modern Data Scientist"_ infographic, and immediately feel overwhelmed. Worse, they begin down the path of learning everything. ___Learning everything is unproductive.___

There is no strategy to this graphic. No foundation, no purpose, no intent. Just a smattering of skills that supposedly create a data scientist. 

Worse, students starting out believe that this is the ultimate goal - ___A Unicorn___ - A mythical creature.

__I'm hear to tell you that (_fortunately_) this myth is not a reality.__

## We All Start At The Same Spot - Zero

When we start out, we are the most vulnerable to making missteps. I personally remember feeling overwhelmed and directionless. It's at this moment that we are easily influenced to take the path of learning everything (and anything). 
Learning _everything_ is a costly strategy issue, but an easy one to make. With so many people saying different things, yet ___none of the "experts" are stepping up___ to give you mentorship. 

__It's scary__ - being alone on this journey. Add to it that every misstep costs us time, and it's easy to see why many data scientists struggle (and many don't succeed). ___Time is our enemy. The longer we take on this journey, the more competitive it gets and the more likely we are to fail___. 

## We Grow By Building Skills That Add Value

One thing I learned along my own journey was how to sell my value. It was an incredibly important lesson that I learned through my experience consulting. When I begin an engagement, I never go in saying I know something. Rather, I ask how I can help and listen for opportunity. ___Skills alone don't sell. It's solutions, results, and value that sell.___ 

## Marketing 101 - Skills Don't Sell; Solutions Sell, Results Sell, Value Sells

We need to change our beliefs. Most of us feel that to get a job in data science, you need to learn data science inside and out. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Graph Theory - the list goes on. 

This is not correct. Further, this strategy will cost you time, and likely won't result in your desired outcome - ___to begin a career in Finance___. 

When we adopt a new mindset, one of value over skills, we begin seeking skills that add value _incrementally_ to the larger goal. This is a step in the right direction, one that many data scientists miss. 

__Remember the "Modern Data Scientist" infographic? Don't learn all of these skills.__

<p class="text-center date">Bad Strategy: Learn Skills That Every Data Scientist "Should" Have</p>

__Rather, learn how to create value by incrementally adding skills to your toolkit.__ Focus on addressing what financial organizations want. Then learn tools that will deliver it.

![Create Value](/assets/2019-05-23-financial-data-scientist/create_value.jpg)
<p class="text-center date">Good Strategy: Learn How To Create Value</p>

The next logical questions is...

### What Do Financial Organizations Value?

To be effective in a Financial Organization, you need to generate value for the organization. You do this by:

1. Reducing __Cost__
2. Increasing __Revenue__
3. Maximizing __Profit__

Solving problems that address KPI's (Key Performance Indicators) is a great place to start. Anything to do with customers, quality, service, performance, and so forth. 

### How Do You (the Data Scientist) Generate Value?

__By taking Applications into Production.__

Every day we make decisions based on intuition. When we use data to improve decision-making, value is generated for the organization by reducing costs, increasing revenue, and/or maximizing profit. 

Applications that embed data science ___can save organizations $15M+!___ Don't believe me? Here's an expert application that I built that can easily result in _multi-million-dollar-per-year savings_. 

## A Real-World Example - Assisting Asset Manager's Tactical Investment Allocation

The only way to make a difference is by understanding the people you seek to help. 

Let's walk through a short example of this - A [Stock Portfolio Optimization Application (DEMO HERE)](https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app/) that I demonstrated at the _R/Finance 2019 Conference_.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wj8hNQNFlPI" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="text-center date">Stock Optimization Application - YouTube Video</p>
<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app" target="_blank">App Demo Here</a></p>

### Problem Statement

Asset Managers select stocks based on their knowledge of the company, market, and intuition of what the future holds. However, allocating an investment among the basket is ___a time-consuming problem that is costly if the Asset Manager over-weights a risky stock___. A bad bet can result in lost Clients, costing the the organization millions in fees that would have otherwise been collected. 

### Solution Statement

We can use data-driven analysis to optimize the allocation of investments among the basket of stocks. Modern portfolio theory ([Capital Asset Pricing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model)) suggests that using the [Sharpe Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) (a metric of reward-to-risk) can reduce the riskiness of a portfolio while preserving returns. 

### Implementation

We can automate the portfolio allocation process by randomly calculating portfolios, calculating the Sharpe Ratio, and returning the tactical allocation strategy of the best portfolio. This allows the Asset Manager to focus on his or her job of picking stocks, while the investment allocation decision becomes automated using modern portfolio theory. 

The [web application available for demo here](https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app/) and [described in the YouTube video](https://youtu.be/wj8hNQNFlPI) does just that - helps an Asset Manager ___make better investment decisions that will consistently improve financial performance and thus retain clients.___

## What Do You Need To Learn?

The road to go from where you are now to a data scientist in a Financial Organization can be accomplished in weeks, not years. But, you need to have a plan to ___strategically learn the right skills___. 

This where I can help. I've been there. I'm willing to step up. I'm willing to guide. But, make no mistake, ___it will take serious commitment on your part.___

Here's what I recommend that you learn and why. It's called the ___"Data Science Workflow"___. 


## The Data Science Workflow

Building applications like the [Stock Portfolio Optimization App](https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app/) is what we call ___"Production"___. This is the end stage of your efforts. But what you don't see is the hard work that you (the data scientist) put in beforehand. That hard work is actually a process called the ___"Data Science Workflow"___, and it looks something like this.

![Data Science Workflow](/assets/2019-05-23-financial-data-scientist/data_science_workflow.jpg)
<p class="text-center date">The Data Science Workflow</p>

The _"Data Science Workflow"_ is the series of tasks required to go from business problem to business value. It's a time consuming process that requires:

- __Business Problem Understanding__ - Working with process stakeholders (e.g. Asset Managers) to understand their unique business challenges 

- __Communication of Business Value__ - ROI analysis of any solutions, communication with executive leadership to convey the value

In the middle is a complex series of actions that involve ___Data Science Tools___ (everything involved in going from machine learning to reporting and deploying web applications).

## Data Science Tools Exposed

Here is the same graphic with a set of tools that can be used as part of the _"Data Science Workflow"_. The tools integrate throughout the problem solving and solution building process. This is how we add value to the organization.

![Data Science Workflow - With Tools Exposed](/assets/2019-05-23-financial-data-scientist/data_science_workflow_tools.jpg)
<p class="text-center date">The Data Science Workflow - With Tools Exposed (R-Track)</p>



## Value Comes From Tool Integration

Value comes from using a __specific set of tools__ that __incrementally add value__ along the _"Data Science Workflow"_. This allows us start with a business problem and end with a predictive web application that __delivers business value__ that is tracked with reports and __measured for ROI (Return on Investment)__. 

Let's break this down:

- ___Specific Set of Tools:___ Focusing on this specific set of tools cuts the time to learn data science dramatically. This is the ___80/20 Rule in Full Effect!___

- ___Incrementally Add Value:___ The tools combine into an integrated approach to solving problems. Therefore, we can't just read a book on each tool independently. ___We need to learn the tools together to harness their power.___

- ___Delivers Business Value:___ The Application is the Value-Generator. Without it, the data science team adds little value to the organization.

- ___Measured for ROI:___ Any business improvement should be tracked, reported on, and measured for return on investment. Changes in KPI's converted to financial value. 

This is why I teach project-based learning using the set of tools and processes that I use every day. I've developed a learning program that incorporates each of the tools to get you effective and fast. The best part, I'll help you learn it through [__Business Science University__](https://university.business-science.io/).

Here is just one example of a ___student's success story___. Michael, a student of mine, is working through the first of two courses learning _Data Science For Business_. He's 3-Weeks into my program and has recieved approval of his forecasting project from the Executive Team.

### Learning Labs PRO

Gain Domain-Specific Knowledge and Tool-Specific Skills with our [__Learning Labs PRO service__](https://university.business-science.io/p/learning-labs-pro). A key challenge with Finance (or any domain) is learning how to apply data science to the domain. This is what I solve with a service called _"Learning Labs PRO"_. 

Learning Lab 09 was on `tidyquant`, a quantitative finance package the is the engine that drives the [Stock Portfolio Optimization Application](https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app). I developed the `tidyquant` package to help the Data Science Community more quickly perform financial analysis inside the `tidyverse` (series of R packages that work together with a common interface and structure). I teach `tidyquant` and many other tools and domain-specific ___1-hour courses___ that I call ___"Learning Labs"___. I release new Learning Labs every 2 weeks.

## Conclusion

Learning Data Science in Finance can be a challenge. With infographics and "experts" leading us in a million different directions, it becomes a challenge to find a single path to becoming a financial data scientist. This is the problem I set out to solve two years ago when I began teaching Data Science Education.

Fast-forward to today. I've spent a lot of time designing and developing a system that works fast. Life is short, we need to go from where we are now to where we want to be as quickly as possible. Otherwise we lose out on the opportunity for a better career and a better life. 

To help you get there fast, I have created this system that will work for you. It requires commitment. But, it will get you results in weeks, not years.
