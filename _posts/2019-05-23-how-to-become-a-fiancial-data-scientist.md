Becoming a data scientist in Finance can be a lofty challenge... unless you know how to streamline the path. Instead of asking "what skills do I need?", **_we need to ask a different question_**. 

We need to ASK, "**_What does the organization value?"_**

# How to learn what the organization values.

Your goal is NOT to learn skills. Your goal IS to learn how to generate value for your organization. This process has 2-steps. 

1. Figure out what creates value.
2. Then make a learning plan by applying the [**80/20 Rule**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/80-20-rule.asp) to get there as fast as possible.

SPEED IS CRITICAL. 

<mark><strong>Why is speed critical?</strong> Lack of speed will cost you your dreams, and even worse, your dream will die a slow, agonizing death until you QUIT. And no one wants this. So this is why we ALWAYS apply the 80/20 rule when learning ANY new or complex task like learning to code, learning guitar, speaking a foreign language, etc. Learning data science is no different.</mark>

# For financial people

If you are a financial professional (or any other professional) _seeking to learn data science_, then **this is what you've been waiting for.**

The opportunity to understand what organizations in Finance (or any Domain) value from the data science practice. 

If you understand what they value, you then know what skills to learn to streamline your path from where you are now to being a productive member of a Financial organization (or any organization).

# For non-financial people

What I'm covering here is focused on finance, but the same strategies can be applied broadly to **ANY domain**, as wide-ranging as Marketing, Research & Development, Medicine, and more.

I'll assume that if you are reading this, then you have _some_ knowledge on [_Portfolio Theory_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) and [_Risk Management_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskmanagement.asp), which are required knowledge for the finance domain. BUT, even if you don't just replace those terms with **"Bubble Gum"** (or any silly object) and keep moving on. 

Key point: The strategies for learning what organizations value are most important. Not the BUZZ WORDS or domain jargon. 

**What I will show you is how you can take domain knowledge and** **extend it to value-creating activities for the business using data science tools**.

But, first, the cold hard reality...

# Learning skills that you don't use is a massive waste of time.

Most financial (or non-financial) people that want to break into Data Science make a **major a mistake** that costs them a career in data science. It starts with their first step.

They see the _"Modern Data Scientist"_ infographic, and immediately feel overwhelmed. Worse, they begin down the path of learning everything. **_Learning everything is unproductive._**

![Modern Data Scientist](/assets/2019-05-23-financial-data-scientist/modern_data_scientist.jpg)
<p class="text-center date">"Modern Data Scientist Infographic" - Everything That Is Wrong With A Learning Strategy</p>

There is no strategy to this graphic. No foundation, no purpose, no intent. Just a smattering of skills that supposedly create a data scientist.

Worse, students starting out believe that this is the ultimate goal - **_A Unicorn Data Scientist._** (What's that? A unicorn is mythical creature that doesn't actually exist, but the idea spreads and people believe that they can find it, or worse... become it.)

**I'm here to tell you that (fortunately) this myth is not a reality.**

Here's how learning data science really happens. 

# We All Start At The Same Spot - Zero

When we start out, we are the most vulnerable to making missteps. 

I personally remember feeling overwhelmed and directionless. It's at this moment that we are easily influenced to take the path of learning everything (and anything).


Learning _everything_ is a costly strategy issue, but an easy one to make. With so many people saying different things, yet **none of the "experts" are stepping up** to give you mentorship.

**It's scary** - being alone on this journey. 

Add to it that every misstep costs us time, and it's easy to see why many data scientists struggle (and many don't succeed). 

<mark><strong>Time is our enemy.</strong> The longer we take on this journey, the more competitive it gets and the more likely we are to fail.</mark>

# We Grow By Building Skills That Add Value

One thing I learned along my own journey was how to sell my value. 

It was an incredibly important lesson that I learned through my experience consulting. Every initial client engagement was a sales pitch. I had to sell myself. 

<mark>How did I do it?</mark>

When I'd begin any consulting engagement, I'd never go in saying I know something. Rather, I'd ask how I can help and **listen** for opportunity. 

As soon as the client began talking, **I'd uncover their problems.** The more they talked, the more that problems stacked up. And, sure enough I could solve a lot of them. 

This showed them value. I exposed problems they didn't even know they had, and I offered the solution. ME!

**I was their bridge to value:** Solving the problems they now realized they had. None of this was based on my skills. Sure, skills were needed.  

**BUT, skills alone don't sell. It's solutions, results, and value that sells.**

# Marketing 101: Skills Don't Sell; Solutions Sell, Results Sell, Value Sells

We need to change our beliefs. 

Most of us feel that to get a job in data science, you need to learn data science inside and out. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Graph Theory - the list goes on.

<mark>This is not correct.</mark> 

Further, this "learn everything" strategy will cost you time, and likely won't result in your desired outcome: **to begin a career as a Data Scientist in Finance (or in any domain).**

When we adopt a new mindset, one of value over skills, we begin seeking skills that add value _incrementally_ to the larger goal. This is a step in the right direction, one that many data scientists miss.

**Remember the _"Modern Data Scientist"_ infographic? Don't learn all of these skills.**

<p class="text-center date">Bad Strategy: Learn Skills That Every Data Scientist "Should" Have</p>

**Rather, learn how to create value by incrementally adding skills to your toolkit.** Focus on addressing what financial organizations want. Then learn tools that will deliver it.

<p class="text-center date">Good Strategy: Learn How To Create Value</p>

The next logical questions is...

# What do financial organizations value?

To be effective in a Financial Organization, you need to generate value for the organization. You do this by:

1. Reducing **Cost**
2. Increasing **Revenue**
3. Maximizing **Profit**

Solving problems that address KPI's (Key Performance Indicators) is a great place to start. Anything to do with customers, quality, service, performance, and so forth.

# How do you (the Data Scientist) generate balue?

<mark><strong>It's Simple:</strong> By taking applications into production.</mark>

### What is an application?

Every day we make decisions based on intuition. Decisions in the absence of data are WRONG more often than not. 

When we use data to improve decision-making, value is generated for the organization by reducing costs, increasing revenue, and/or maximizing profit.

The application is the THING that non-data scientists (normal people) can use to help them make better decisions.

### What is production?

We know that applications can help improve decision making. But applications are worthless, unless people can use them. Production is the process for giving people access to your applications. 

<mark>Production generates MASSIVE VALUE. In fact, applications that embed data science can save organizations $15,000,000 per year or more!</mark>

Don't believe me? Here's an expert application that I built that can easily result in _multi-million-dollar-per-year savings_.

# A Real-World Example: Assisting an asset manager's tactical investment allocation

The only way to make a difference is by understanding the people you seek to help.

Let's walk through a short example of this.

This is the [Stock Portfolio Optimization Application (DEMO HERE)](https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app/) that I demonstrated at the _R/Finance 2019 Conference_.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wj8hNQNFlPI" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="text-center date">Stock Optimization Application - YouTube Video</p>
<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app" target="_blank">App Demo Here</a></p>

### Problem Statement

Asset Managers select stocks based on their knowledge of the company, market, and intuition of what the future holds. However, allocating an investment among the basket is **_a time-consuming problem that is costly if the Asset Manager over-weights a risky stock_**. A bad bet can result in lost Clients, costing the the organization millions in fees that would have otherwise been collected.

### Solution Statement

We can use data-driven analysis to optimize the allocation of investments among the basket of stocks. Modern portfolio theory ([Capital Asset Pricing Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model)) suggests that using the [Sharpe Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) (a metric of reward-to-risk) can reduce the riskiness of a portfolio while preserving returns.

### The Application

**This application allows the Asset Manager to focus on his or her job of picking stocks, while the investment allocation decision becomes automated using modern portfolio theory.**

We automate the portfolio allocation process by randomly calculating portfolios, calculating the Sharpe Ratio, and returning the tactical allocation strategy of the best portfolio. 

The [web application available for demo here](https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app/) and [described in the YouTube video](https://youtu.be/wj8hNQNFlPI) generates value. 

The application helps an Asset Manager **_make better investment decisions that will consistently improve financial performance and thus retain clients._**

# What skills do you need to learn to do this?

The road to go from where you are now to a data scientist in a Financial Organization can be accomplished in weeks, not years. But, you need to have a plan to **_strategically learn the right skills_**.

This where I can help. I've been there. I'm willing to step up. I'm willing to guide. But, make no mistake, **_it will take serious commitment on your part._**

Here's what I recommend that you learn and why. It's called the _Data Science Workflow_.

# The Data Science Workflow

Building applications like the [Stock Portfolio Optimization App](https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app/) is what we call Production. 

This is the end stage of your efforts. But what you don't see is the hard work that you (the data scientist) put in beforehand. 

That hard work is actually a process called the **Data Science Workflow**, and it looks something like this.

![Data Science Workflow](/assets/2019-05-23-financial-data-scientist/data_science_workflow.jpg)
<p class="text-center date">The Data Science Workflow</p>

The _"Data Science Workflow"_ is the series of tasks required to go from business problem to business value. It's a time consuming process that requires:

* **Business Problem Understanding**: Working with process stakeholders (e.g. Asset Managers) to understand their unique business challenges
* **Communication of Business Value**: ROI analysis of any solutions, communication with executive leadership to convey the value

In the middle is a complex series of actions that involve **_Data Science Tools_** (everything involved in going from machine learning to reporting and deploying applications).

# Data Science Tools Exposed

Here is the same graphic with a set of tools that can be used as part of the _"Data Science Workflow"_. The tools integrate throughout the problem solving and solution building process. This is how we add value to the organization.

![Data Science Workflow - With Tools Exposed](/assets/2019-05-23-financial-data-scientist/data_science_workflow_tools.jpg) 

<p class="text-center date">The Data Science Workflow - With Tools Exposed</p>

# Value comes from tool integration

Value comes from using a **specific set of tools** that **incrementally add value** along the _"Data Science Workflow"_. This allows us start with a business problem and end with a predictive web application that **delivers business value** that is tracked with reports and **measured for ROI (Return on Investment)**.

Let's break this down.

### **Specific set of tools...** 

Focusing on this specific set of tools cuts the time to learn data science dramatically. This is the **_80/20 Rule in Full Effect!_**

### **...that incrementally add value...** 

The tools combine into an integrated approach to solving problems. Therefore, we can't just read a book on each tool independently. **_We need to learn the tools together to harness their power._**

### **...that end with a web application that delivers business value...** 

The Application is the Value-Generator. Without it, the data science team adds little value to the organization.

### ...and we can measure this with Return On Investment (ROI).

Any business improvement should be tracked, reported on, and measured for return on investment. Changes in KPI's converted to financial value.

# Creating a plan

The problem is that you don't have a plan. I'm here to help. Here's exactly what you need to learn. These are the tools that I use every day as a data scientist in my own company, Business Science. 

![](/assets/data_science_plan.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Data Science Skills (Tools I use every single day)</p>

But skills alone won't help you. 

<mark><strong>You need a plan.</strong> And the best plan is doing data science projects.</mark>

# Why project-based learning helps.

This is why I teach **project-based learning** using the set of tools and processes that I use every day. But there are 2 key questions 

1. What results can you immediately achieve with this approach?
2. How fast can you become a data scientist?

## 1. What results can you immediately achieve? 

Michael is a student of mine in my R program that has bought into the power of the 80/20 rule. He's **3-Weeks** into my program and has received approval of his forecasting project from the Executive Team. Here's what they said:

> Hi Michael, 
>
> A BIG thank you for the hard work these last 2 weeks. **The presentation (you made) went very well.** We have sign-off from the leaders to progress with a full comprehensive forecasting model going forward.

![](/assets/course_feedback_michael.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Michael's leadership team is recognizing his hard work, thanks to the Business Science program</p>

The best part is that Michael's story is not unique. 

## 2. How fast to become a data scientist?

You're not going to magically become a data scientist after writing 3 lines of code. BUT, you can transition into data science in under 6-months. Don't believe me?

Justin another student of mine was able to transition into a career as the Lead Data Scientist at Northwestern Mutual **in under 6-months!** Justin had no financial experience previously. He was a researcher in academia. Justin says...

> "In **less than six months** after starting my first Business Science Course, I had fully transitioned into a role as a Lead Data Scientist and my life is better for it!"
