# What is grafify?

`grafify` is a new R package for making great-looking `ggplot2` graphs quickly in R. It has 19 plotting functions that simplify common ggplot graphs and provide color-blind friendly themes.

We'll go through a short tutorial to get you up and running with `grafify`. 



# Before we get started, get the R Cheat Sheet

`grafify` is great for making quick `ggplot2` plots. But, you'll still need to learn how to wrangle data with `dplyr` and visualize data with `ggplot2`. For those topics, I'll use the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) to refer to `dplyr` and `ggplot2` code in my workflow.

### Quick Example:

[Download the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html). __Then Click the "CS" next to "ggplot2"__ opens the Data Visualization with ggplot2 Cheat Sheet.

Now you're ready to quickly reference `ggplot2` functions.

Onto the tutorial. 

# How grafify works


The `grafify` package extends `ggplot2` by adding several simplified plotting functions. In this tutorial, we'll cover:

* __2-Variable Functions:__ `plot_scatterbar_sd()`, `plot_scatterbox()`, and `plot_dotviolin()`
    
* __3-Variable Functions:__ `plot_3d_scatterbox()`
    
* __Before-After Functions:__ `plot_befafter_colors()`



## Load the Libraries and Data

First, run this code to:

1. __Load Libraries:__ Load `grafify` and `tidyverse`. 
2. __Import Data:__ We're using the `mpg` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`.

</p>


## Scatterbar SD Plot

First, we can make a Scatterbar Plot that shows the data points along with error bars at a standard deviation. Simply use `plot_scatterbar_sd()`.

## Scatterbox Plot

Next, we can make a Scatterbox Plot that shows a custom boxplot / jitter plot combination. I've added a jitter point to show the distribution. Simply use `plot_scatterbox()`.

## Dotviolin Plot

Next, we can make a Dotviolin Plot that shows a custom violin plot / dotplot combination. Simply use `plot_dotviolin()`.

## Scatterbox 3D Plot

Next, we can make a 3D Scatterbox Plot that shows three variables using boxplot / jitter plot combination. This is great for drilling into multiple categories. Simply use `plot_3d_scatterbox()`.

## Before-After Plot

Finally, we can make a Before-After Plot that shows changes between two states (in this case how various models changed in MPG Fuel Efficiency from 1999 to 2008). This is great for comparing two states. Simply use `plot_befafter_colors()`.

# Summary

With 19 plotting functions, the `grafify` package makes it quick and easy to make custom `ggplot2` visualizations that are easy to visualize and explore data. With that said, it's critical to learn `ggplot2` for plots beyond what `grafify` offers.

# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn data science. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.  I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

__If you feel like this, you're not alone.__

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. __Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught smartly__

2. __Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.__

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will __get you past your struggles__ and improve your career in the process. 

It's called the [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 5+ projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment. 

The result is that __you break through previous struggles__, learning from my experience & our community of 2000+ data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
