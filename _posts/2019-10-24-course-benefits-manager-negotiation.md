## Interested in getting your job to pay for a course, but not sure how to ask?

Managers have two high priorities, one is showing their boss results and the second is getting productivity from their team. It's a productivity-to-results cycle.

When you ask your manager to pay an expense, they want to know the benefits: how can it save time, save money, improve teamwork, improve productivity, and most importantly __improve results.__


## Sell your manager on a data science course purchase

One of our data science students provided tips from their experience:

<div stlye="padding-left:30px;">
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<em>"When pitching this to management for budget approval, <span style="color:#e74c3c"><strong>pitch the relevancy to current/future work</strong></span>. I used the course learning objective bullet points and tied them to existing projects, and projects we have planned for next year. This makes the "sell" much easier."</em>
</blockquote>
</div>

The best way to sell your manager is to __explicitly communicate how the course benefits are relevant to your work.__


## Reimbursement letter

We've made it easy for you! 

Below is a template you can use to submit a course reimbursement to your manager. Modify the template according to your course preferences and relevancy to your work projects.

Dear __[Manager Name]__,

I would like to enroll in Business Science, a data science learning platform that focuses on business applications and results.

The curriculum is unlike typical courses – the entire program is business-focused and integrated to deliver results from day 1. Business Science has trained over 1500 data scientists and practitioners. The entire program is integrated, being taught by the same instructor that has 10+ years of business analytics and data science consulting experience, has written a number of software libraries (`modeltime`, `timetk`, `tidyquant` 375K downloads), and is an active data science consultant working with firms including S&P Global Market Intelligence and MRM McCann.

These skills would be beneficial to our team as we are __[add in current projects/initiatives you’re embarking on]__. Some courses that I’m interested in attending are:

- Business Analysis with R (Beginner)
- Data Science for Business (Advanced)
- Shiny Web Applications (Intermediate)
- Expert Shiny Developer (Advanced)
- High-Performance Time Series Forecasting (Advanced)

The curriculum features:

- Five core courses that streamline the learning process while focusing on generating an immediate impact.
- Each course has certification upon completion.
- The courses are integrated to progressively build skills and accelerate development.

The following is a sampling of companies that trust Business Science to train their team: Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, S&P Global, MRM McCann, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Walmart, and more.

To maximize ROI for this training, we should register before September 21st to save 20% on each enrollment!

If you have any questions, please let me know.

<br>

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

__[Your Name]__
