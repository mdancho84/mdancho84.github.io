# What is Polars?

According to [the `polars` documentation](https://pola-rs.github.io/r-polars/):

> The polars package for R gives users access to a **lightning fast Data Frame library written in Rust**. Polars‚Äô **embarrassingly parallel execution**, cache efficient algorithms and expressive API makes it perfect for efficient data wrangling, data pipelines, snappy APIs, and much more besides. Polars also supports **‚Äústreaming mode‚Äù for out-of-memory operations**. This allows users to analyze datasets many times larger than RAM.

### Lightning-Fast Data Frame Library Written in Rust

The key here is that, under the hood, both the R and Python implementations of `polars` use the hyper-scalable and blazingly fast `Rust` library. Key aspects of Rust include:

1. **Memory Safety:** Rust ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector. This is achieved through its ownership system, which enforces strict rules on how memory is managed.

2. **Concurrency:** Rust is designed to make it easy to write concurrent programs. The language's ownership system helps prevent data races, which are a common problem in concurrent programming.

3. **Zero-cost Abstractions:** Rust aims to provide high-level abstractions without the cost typically associated with them in terms of performance. This allows developers to write efficient code without sacrificing readability.

4. **Performance:** Rust's performance is comparable to C and C++ due to its focus on low-level control over system resources.

5. **Tooling:** Rust comes with a powerful set of tools, including cargo (the package manager and build system), rustc (the Rust compiler), and rustfmt (a code formatting tool).

## Rust in a Nutshell

Rust is fast. It's design is focused on parallel processing. And because of that `polars` is fast, parallel, lazy (in a good way), and really good for most data operations. 

# Which Data Manipulations is Polars Good For?

I've been testing out `polars` for quite a while in both Python and R. 

For background, as of a year ago I began work on `pytimetk`, which replicates many of the R `timetk` packages time series analysis features in Python. And for that project, our team has internally used a `polars` engine for many time series operations that are known to be resource intense. 

## Polars vs Pandas: Speed Comparison and Performance Test Results:

We've published [our performance results here.](https://business-science.github.io/pytimetk/performance/01_speed_comparisons.html)

![Polars Beats Pandas](/assets/082_polars_beats_pandas.jpg)

1. **Rolling Operations:** Polars can be 10X to 3500X faster than Pandas

2. **Expanding Operations:** 3X to 500X Faster

3. **Aggregations (Summarizations):** 13X Faster

**The bottomline is that Polars is fast vs Pandas.** It's especially good for grouped time series operations including rolling, expanding, and aggregating operations. 

I expect Polars in R to be faster than `dplyr`. However, I have not run similar tests (yet).

# Tutorial: How to use Polars inside of R

It takes about 30 seconds to get `polars` set up so you can start using shockingly-fast data manipulation inside of R. All the tutorial code shown is available in the [R-Tips Newsletter folder for R-Tip 082](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website).

## Step 1 - Install polars:

The first step is to set up `polars`. Polars is not on CRAN as of the writing of this article. But it's simple to install from the r-multiverse.org team.

Run this line of code:

``` r
install.packages("polars", repos = "https://community.r-multiverse.org")
```

## Step 2 - Load the Libraries and Data

Once `polars` is installed, load the libraries and data witht his code. 

![Libraries and Data](/assets/082_libraries_data.jpg)

Here's the `stock_data.csv` once it's read with `pl$read_csv()`. A few key points about the Polars Data Frame Structure:

- Shape of the data is shown at the top. 
- Some columns and rows will not be shown when printed to the screen(identifed with ...)
- The "Date" column is a `str` data type
- The stocks (25 total) are `f64` data type (float 64)

## Step 3 - Pivot to Long Format for Grouped Data Analysis

The next step is to get the data into a format so we can begin to do grouped analysis. Use the `unpivot()` function to go from wide-to-long format: 

![Wide to Long](/assets/082_wide_to_long.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 082 Folder)</a></p>

**The transformation was done shockingly-fast.** This is what the long format looks like:

![Long Format Stock Data](/assets/082_long_stock_data.jpg)

To visualize the data, run this code:

## Step 4 - Moving Averages with Polars' Rolling Mean

The last step we'll cover is how to perform moving averages using `polars` rolling mean functionality. This is one of the biggest benefits to using Polars. 

Run this code to perform a 10-day and 50-day moving average over each of the 25 stocks:

![Rolling Mean](/assets/082_rolling_mean.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 082 Folder)</a></p>

Again, the performance is undeniable. In milliseconds, the rolling calculations are complete. 

Run this code to visualize the result:

![Visualize Moving Averages](/assets/082_visualize_moving_averages.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 082 Folder)</a></p>

**We can quickly see which stocks have momentum** from the 10-day and 50-day moving averages (those with Red lines above the Green Lines).

# Conclusions:

Polars is one of those libraries that is quickly becoming a standard in the Python ecosystem. I'm glad to see that R is getting the same treatment. It's simply the fastest data manipulation library I've come across. And I've tried them all.
