The R programming language is a powerful tool used in data science for business (DS4B), but R can be unnecessarily challenging to learn. We believe you can learn R quickly by taking an 80/20 approach to learning the most in-demand functions and packages. In this article, we seek to ultimately understand what techniques are most critical to a beginners success through analyzing a master data scientist's code base. Half of this article covers the web scraping procedure (using `rvest` and `purrr`) we used to collect our data (if new to R, you can skip this). The second half covers the insights gained from analyzing a master's code base. In the next article in our series, we'll develop a strategic learning plan built on our knowledge of the master. Last, there's a bonus at the end of the article that shows how you can analyze your own code base using the new `fs` package. Enjoy.

## Analyzing A Leader Through Their Code

It's no secret that the R Programming Community has a number of leaders. It's one of the draws that separates R from the rest of the pack! The leaders have earned their leadership position by making an impact through high-end data science and unselfishly giving back to the community. We can all learn from what they do. The key is dissecting their code bases to understand the tools and techniques they use. 

What we've done is made a first step in figuring out why these individuals are successful through analyzing their most frequently used tools. We started with one standout, a true master of data science...

#### David Robinson (Our Master Data Scientist) 

![David Robinson](/assets/2018-03-03_how_to_learn_r/drob.png)

We examined [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob), Chief Data Scientist at DataCamp (previously StackOverflow) (aka DRob), analyzing his code base by dissecting the functions and packages he uses regularly! 

#### Variance Explained Blog (Where We Got The Data)

DRob actively maintains an excellent blog called [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/). He has 58 articles currently, most with code. We used the `rvest` package to collect the code contained in each post. We started with one blog post involving mixture models of baseball statistics. We then extended it to all 58 articles to increase our confidence in what tools he frequently uses. 

#### 80/20 Analysis For Learning R (What We Did With The Data)

We made several graphs that tell us interesting things about what R functions and packages DRob regularly uses. We then performed an 80/20 analysis on his code base. We output all of the high-usage functions and packages DRob regularly uses at the end of the article. This will be used in our next article developing a strategy to learn R efficiently. 

Our first graph helps us answer which functions DRob routinely uses. Here are his top 20 functions.

![Most Frequently Used Functions](/assets/2018-03-03_how_to_learn_r/ve_functions_top_20.png)

Our second graph helps us understand which packages are most frequently used based on the number of times functions within those packages appear in his code.

![Most Frequently Used Packages](/assets/2018-03-03_how_to_learn_r/ve_package_frequency_tbl.png)

We noticed a theme that DRob is frequently using packages in the "tidyverse" (e.g. `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, etc). The third chart shows how "tidy" his code is by measuring the percentage of tidyverse functions vs non-tidyverse functions. 

![Tidiness Over Time](/assets/2018-03-03_how_to_learn_r/ve_tidiness_over_time_tbl.png)

And, finally, we listed out the top 88 functions in our 80/20 analysis. These are the functions he used 80% of the time. Check out the [80/20 list of most frequently used functions below](#q4)!

#### Bonus: How to Learn R by Analyzing Your Code

We show as a bonus how you can apply the custom scripts developed in this article to do an analysis on your code with the new `fs` package (short for file system). We briefly analyze our code base for the HR 201: Predicting Employee Attrition course that is under development for our [__Business Science University Virtual Workshop__](#bsu) on predicting employee turnover and developing `Shiny` web applications. The Virtual Workshop is coming soon!


## Our Hypothesis

Learning R can be unnecessarily challenging if one focuses on learning everything immediately rather than applying a strategic approach. Our hypothesis is composed of two theories: 

1. You do not need to learn everything to become effective (refer to [80/20 Rule](#80-20))
2. You can learn a lot by analyzing others' code bases (refer to [Learning from a Master Data Scientist](#master))

Our quest is to prove these theories.  

### 80/20 Rule <a class="anchor" id="80-20"></a>

Trying to solve every aspect of a challenge is overwhelming and often not the best use of your time. The 80/20 Rule can often help in these situations. Generally speaking, the 80/20 Rule posits that roughly 20% of activities or tasks produce 80% of the results you want. The challenge of learning the R language falls perfectly into this model. The key is figuring out which areas are the highest value for your time. 

### How to Learn R From A Master Data Scientist <a class="anchor" id="master"></a>

To make an optimal strategy, we need data on what tools are being used to perform high-end data science. But, where can we get data? From a data scientist that regularly performs high-end data science publicly via the internet. A true master at the dark art of data science!

__Why we chose David Robinson (aka DRob):__

I met DRob at the EARL Boston conference last November. He had just given a stellar presentation on StackOverflow trends concluding that R was growing rapidly. What stuck out about his presentation was his ability to analyze a question or problem - This is a key skill in DS4B! 

Many data scientists such as top Kaggle competitors focus on how to create a high end predictions (which is important) but it's not representative of most real-world situations.  It's really unique to see a data scientist effectively using problem solving and critical thinking in combination with data science to learn about the problem. DRob did this very well.  

I had checked out his blog before, but never picked up on the fact that he's really doing data science that can be applied to business (although he's mainly applying to other areas such as sports and politics). DRob has written a number of articles on his blog, [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/). Some of my favorites are his articles on statistics applications in baseball. His approaches are novel leaning on Bayesian A/B testing, hierarchical modeling, mixture models, and many other tools that are very useful in business analysis. Further, he employs problem solving and critical thinking, which are the same skills that are needed in DS4B.


## Analysis: Learning R From A Master

If we treat DRob's code on his Variance Explained blog as a text analysis, __we can find the most frequently used packages and functions that cover the majority of code he produces__. We can then use an 80/20 approach to determine which functions and packages are most used and therefore most important to master. We'll split this analysis into two parts:

* [Part 1: Web Scraping The Variance Explained Blog](#part1) - Note this is a technical section showing how we retrieved the data. Novice learners may wish to skip this part.  

* [Part 2: Learning From DRob's Code](#part2) - The analytical work is done here!

### Libraries

If you wish to follow along, please load the following libraries. 


{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(tibbletime)
library(rvest)
library(broom)
{% endhighlight %}

### Part 1: Web Scraping the Variance Explained Blog <a class="anchor" id="part1"></a>

<p class="text-warning">CAUTION: Technical details ahead. Those new to R may wish to skip this section and <a href="#part2">get right to the results</a>.</p>

This part of the analysis is __a how-to in web scraping__. We expose the process to collect the data, which use the `rvest` package and a number of custom functions to parse the text. We split this part into two steps:

* [Step 1: Setup Code Parsing Functions](#parsing_functions)

* [Step 2: Web Scraping Variance Explained](#web_scraping)


#### Step 1: Setup Code Parsing and Utility Functions <a class="anchor" id="parsing_functions"></a>

This is a text analysis. As such, we are going to need to parse some text to extract function names, to determine which packages functions belong to, and to analyze the text with counts and percents. To do so, we create a few helper functions:

* [count_to_pct()](#count_to_pct): Utility function to quickly convert counts to percentages. Works well with `dplyr::count()`. 

* [parse_function_names()](#parse_function_names): Takes in text and returns function names. 

* [find_functions_in_package()](#find_functions_in_package): Takes in a library or package name and returns all functions in the library or package. 

* [find_loaded_packages()](#find_loaded_packages): Detects which packages are loaded in the R system.

* [map_loaded_package_functions()](#map_loaded_package_functions): Maps the function names to the respective package.

##### Count To Percent <a class="anchor" id="count_to_pct"></a>

_Function_: Utility function to quickly convert counts to percentages. Works well with `dplyr::count()`.


{% highlight r %}
count_to_pct <- function(data, ..., col = n) {
    
    grouping_vars_expr <- quos(...)
    col_expr <- enquo(col)

    data %>%
        group_by(!!! grouping_vars_expr) %>%
        mutate(pct = (!! col_expr) / sum(!! col_expr)) %>%
        ungroup()
}
{% endhighlight %}

_Usage_: Use `dplyr::count()` to retrieve counts by grouping variables. Then use `count_to_pct()` to quickly get percentages within groups. Exclude groups if overall percentages are desired. Note this example uses the `mpg` data set from `ggplot2` package. 


{% highlight r %}
mpg %>%
    count(manufacturer) %>%
    count_to_pct() %>%
    top_n(5) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   manufacturer     n    pct
##   <chr>        <int>  <dbl>
## 1 dodge           37 0.158 
## 2 toyota          34 0.145 
## 3 volkswagen      27 0.115 
## 4 ford            25 0.107 
## 5 chevrolet       19 0.0812
{% endhighlight %}


##### Parse Function Names <a class="anchor" id="parse_function_names"></a>

_Function_: Takes in text and returns function names.


{% highlight r %}
parse_function_names <- function(text, stop_words = c("")) {
    
    parser <- function(text, stop_words) {
        ret <- text %>%
            str_c(collapse = " ") %>%
            str_split("\\(") %>%
            set_names("text") %>%
            as.tibble() %>%
            slice(-n()) %>%
            mutate(str_split = map(text, str_split, " ")) %>%
            select(-text) %>%
            unnest() %>%
            mutate(function_name = map_chr(str_split, ~ purrr::pluck(last(.x)))) %>%
            select(function_name) %>%
            separate(function_name, into = c("discard", "function_name"), 
                     sep = "(:::|::|\n)", fill = "left") %>%
            select(-discard) %>%
            mutate(function_name = str_replace_all(function_name, 
                                                   pattern = "[^[:alnum:]_\\.]", "")) %>%
            filter(!(function_name %in% stop_words)) 
        
        return(ret)
    }
    
    safe_parser <- possibly(parser, otherwise = NA)
    
    safe_parser(text, stop_words)
}
{% endhighlight %}

_Usage_: Parses the function name preceding "(". Returns a tibble.


{% highlight r %}
test_text <- "my_mean <- mean(1:10) some text base::sum(my_mean) "
parse_function_names(test_text)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 2 x 1
##   function_name
##   <chr>        
## 1 mean         
## 2 sum
{% endhighlight %}

##### Find Functions In Package <a class="anchor" id="find_functions_in_package"></a>

_Function_: Takes in a library or package name and returns all functions in the library or package.


{% highlight r %}
find_functions_in_package <- function(package) {
    
    pkg_text <- paste0("package:", package)
    
    safe_ls <- possibly(ls, otherwise = NA)
    
    package_functions <- safe_ls(pkg_text)
    
    if (is.na(package_functions[[1]])) return(package_functions)
        
    ret <- package_functions %>%
        as.tibble() %>%
        rename(function_name = value)
    
    return(ret)
}
{% endhighlight %}

_Usage_: Takes in a package that is loaded via `library(package_name)` (the package must be loaded for this to work properly). Returns a tibble of all functions in a package. 


{% highlight r %}
find_functions_in_package("dplyr") %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 237
## Variables: 1
## $ function_name <chr> "%>%", "add_count", "add_count_", "add_row"...
{% endhighlight %}

##### Find Loaded Packages <a class="anchor" id="find_loaded_packages"></a>

_Function_: Detects which packages are loaded in the R system.


{% highlight r %}
find_loaded_packages <- function() {
    
    ret <- search() %>%
        list() %>% 
        set_names("search") %>%
        as.tibble() %>%
        separate(search, into = c("discard", "keep"), sep = ":", fill = "right") %>%
        select(keep) %>%
        filter(!is.na(keep)) %>%
        rename(package = keep) %>%
        arrange(package)
    
    return(ret)
}
{% endhighlight %}

_Usage_: Returns a tibble of loaded packages. Used in conjunction with `map_loaded_package_functions()` to build a corpus of functions and associated packages, which is needed to determine which package the target function comes from. 


{% highlight r %}
find_loaded_packages() %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 28
## Variables: 1
## $ package <chr> "base", "bindrcpp", "broom", "datasets", "dplyr",...
{% endhighlight %}

  

##### Map Loaded Package Functions <a class="anchor" id="map_loaded_package_functions"></a>

_Function_: Maps the function names to the respective package.


{% highlight r %}
map_loaded_package_functions <- function(data, col) {
    
    col_expr <- enquo(col)
    
    data %>%
        mutate(function_name = map(!! col_expr, find_functions_in_package)) %>%
        mutate(is_logical = map_dbl(function_name, is.logical)) %>%
        filter(is_logical != 1) %>%
        select(-is_logical) %>%
        unnest()
}
{% endhighlight %}

_Usage_: Used in conjunction with `find_loaded_packages()`. Builds a corpus of package and function combinations for every package that is loaded. Returns a tibble of packages and associated functions. 


{% highlight r %}
find_loaded_packages() %>%
    map_loaded_package_functions(package) %>%
    glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 4,518
## Variables: 2
## $ package       <chr> "base", "base", "base", "base", "base", "ba...
## $ function_name <chr> "-", "-.Date", "-.POSIXt", "!", "!.hexmode"...
{% endhighlight %}



#### Step 2: Web Scraping Variance Explained <a class="anchor" id="web_scraping"></a>

Now that we have the parsing and utility functions setup, we can begin the web scraping process to return the code on the [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/) blog. The first action is to setup our process for pulling the functions and packages for __a single post__. Once that process is defined, we can scale our web scraping to __ALL posts__!

##### Web Scrape A Single Blog Post <a class="anchor" id="single_post"></a>

DRob has a number of posts that include code-throughs (walkthroughs using code). The code is contained within the HTML as a node named `<code>`. This makes it very easy to extract using the `rvest` package. 

![Variance Explained Code Attribute](/assets/2018-03-03_how_to_learn_r/variance_explained_code_attribute.png)

<p class="text-center date">Source: <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/mixture-models-baseball/">Understanding Mixture Models and Expectation-Maximization (Using Baseball Statistics), Variance Explained</a></p>

We can get the functions and packages used using the following code. It takes four steps:

1. Get a `path` for one of the articles. In our case, we chose DRob's article on analyzing baseball stats with mixture models.
2. Create a corpus of all packages that are loaded in our R session. We will use this to determine which package the function that DRob uses comes from. 
3. Use `rvest` functions `read_html()` to read the HTML from the page. Then collect all nodes containing `<code>`. Then extract the text within those nodes using `html_text()`. 
4. Run the text through our custom `parse_function_names()` function. This returns parsed function names. We still need the packages, which we can get by using `left_join()` with our `loaded_functions_tbl`. 

The final output is all of the functions and most of the package names for the functions that are used in this article! We use the `glimpse()` function to keep the output minimal. 


{% highlight r %}
# Assign one of the blog urls to a variable called path
path <- "http://varianceexplained.org/r/mixture-models-baseball/"

# Get the loaded functions (joined in last step)
loaded_functions_tbl <- find_loaded_packages() %>%
    map_loaded_package_functions(package) 

# Read in HTML as text for all code attributes on the page
html_code_text <- read_html(path) %>% 
    html_nodes("code") %>%    
    html_text()

# Parse function names and join with loaded functions
# Note that stats::filter and dplyr::filter conflict
# We replace any missing packages with "Unknown"
mixture_models_code_tbl <- html_code_text %>%
    parse_function_names() %>%
    left_join(loaded_functions_tbl) %>%
    filter(!(function_name == "filter" & !(package == "dplyr"))) %>%
    mutate(package = case_when(is.na(package) ~ "Unknown", TRUE ~ package))

mixture_models_code_tbl %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 131
## Variables: 2
## $ function_name <chr> "library", "library", "library", "library",...
## $ package       <chr> "base", "base", "base", "base", "ggplot2", ...
{% endhighlight %}

From the output, we see that DRob used 131 functions in this particular article. 

Next, we can then do a quick analysis to see what functions DRob used most frequently in this article. We can see that `dplyr` comes up quite frequently. The most popular function used is `mutate()`, which is used in this article about 11% of the time.


{% highlight r %}
mixture_models_code_tbl %>%
    count(package, function_name) %>%
    count_to_pct() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    top_n(5) %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



|package |function_name |  n|       pct|
|:-------|:-------------|--:|---------:|
|dplyr   |mutate        | 14| 0.1068702|
|base    |sum           |  9| 0.0687023|
|dplyr   |group_by      |  9| 0.0687023|
|dplyr   |filter        |  7| 0.0534351|
|dplyr   |ungroup       |  6| 0.0458015|
|tidyr   |crossing      |  6| 0.0458015|

This is just one sample. We need more data to increase our confidence in which packages and functions are important. Next, let's scale the web scraping to ALL of DRob's blog posts on [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/). 

##### Web Scrape All Blog Posts <a class="anchor" id="all_posts"></a>

Scaling to all blog posts is fairly easy with the `purrr` package. We need to do two things:

1. Web scrape all of the titles, dates, and paths for each of DRob's articles using `rvest`. 

2. Scale the analysis using `purrr` in combination with a custom function, `build_function_names_tbl_from_url_path()`, that we will create. 

Web scraping the titles, dates, and paths (href) are again easy with the `rvest` package. On the [Variance Explained Posts](http://varianceexplained.org/posts/) page, we can again examine the HTML to find that the structure contains:

* Titles are stored in the `article a` nodes as text
* Dates are stored in the `article p.datetime` nodes as text
* Paths (href) are stored in the `article a` nodes as `href` attributes

![Variance Explained Posts](/assets/2018-03-03_how_to_learn_r/variance_explained_post_attributes.png)

<p class="text-center date">Source: <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/posts/">All Posts, Variance Explained</a></p>

We can extract this information using three web scrapings (one for title, dates, and hrefs), and then binding each together using `bind_cols()`. We output the first six posts in a table using the `head()` function.


{% highlight r %}
# Get the path to all of the posts
posts_path <- "http://varianceexplained.org/posts/"

# Extract the post titles
titles_vec <- read_html(posts_path) %>%
    html_node("#main") %>%
    html_nodes("article") %>%
    html_nodes("a") %>%
    html_text(trim = TRUE) 

# Extract the post dates
dates_vec <- read_html(posts_path) %>%
    html_node("#main") %>%
    html_nodes("article") %>%
    html_nodes("p.dateline") %>%
    html_text(trim = TRUE) %>%
    mdy()

# Extract the post hrefs
hrefs_vec <- read_html(posts_path) %>%
    html_node("#main") %>%
    html_nodes("article") %>%
    html_nodes("a") %>%
    html_attr("href") 

# Bind the data together in a tibble
variance_explained_tbl <- bind_cols(
    title = titles_vec, 
    date  = dates_vec, 
    href  = hrefs_vec)

# First six posts shown
variance_explained_tbl %>% 
    head() %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



|title                                                                                      |date       |href                                               |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|:--------------------------------------------------|

We now have all 58 of DRob's posts (title, date, and href) and are now ready to scale! To simplify the process, we'll create a custom function, `build_function_names_tbl_from_url_path()`, that combines several `rvest` operations from the previous section, [Web Scrape A Single Blog Post](#single_post).


{% highlight r %}
build_function_names_tbl_from_url_path <- function(path, loaded_functions_tbl) {
    
    builder <- function(path, loaded_functions_tbl) {
        read_html(path) %>% 
            html_nodes("code") %>%    
            html_text() %>%
            parse_function_names() %>%
            left_join(loaded_functions_tbl) %>%
            filter(
                !(function_name == "filter" & !(package == "dplyr"))
                ) %>%
            mutate(package = ifelse(is.na(package), "Unknown", package))
    }
    
    safe_builder <- possibly(builder, otherwise = NA)
    
    safe_builder(path, loaded_functions_tbl)
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can test the function to see how it takes a `path` and a tibble of `loaded_functions_tbl` and returns the functions and packages.


{% highlight r %}
path <- "http://varianceexplained.org/r/mixture-models-baseball/"
build_function_names_tbl_from_url_path(path, loaded_functions_tbl) %>%
    glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 131
## Variables: 2
## $ function_name <chr> "library", "library", "library", "library",...

Next, we can scale this to all posts using `map()` functions from the `purrr` package. Several of the posts have no code and therefore return nested `NA` values. We filter them out by mapping `is.logical`. We `unnest()` the `function_name` column to reveal the nested function names and packages.

Awesome - We now have all of the function names and most of the packages that DRob used ALL of his code on Variance Explained! Notice that the sample size has increased to 2314 functions extracted. This is a much larger sample size than before with the single Mixture Models post, which had 131 functions extracted. 

### Part 2: Learning From DRob's Code <a class="anchor" id="part2"></a>

The question we need to answer is __"What Code Does An R Master Use To Perform Data Science?"__ We can break this down into separate questions of interest:

* [Which Functions Are Most Frequently Used by DRob?](#q1)
* [Which Packages Are Most Frequently Used by DRob?](#q2)
* [How "Tidy" Is DRob's Code?](#q3) - Note that "tidy" means using the "tidyverse" packages, which use a common API for data science
* [Million Dollar Question: Which Functions and Packages Should We Focus On To Learn R?](#q4)

#### Which Functions Are Most Frequently Used by DRob? <a class="anchor" id="q1"></a>

We can answer this question with by counting our package and function name frequencies, sorting, and taking the top 20, which gives us a subset of the most frequently used functions. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_functions_top_20_tbl <- variance_explained_tbl %>%
    count(package, function_name) %>%
    count_to_pct() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    top_n(20) %>%
    mutate(function_name = as_factor(function_name) %>% fct_reorder(n)) %>%
    arrange(desc(function_name)) %>%
    mutate(package = as_factor(package)) 

ve_functions_top_20_tbl %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 20
## Variables: 4
## $ package       <fct> base, ggplot2, dplyr, dplyr, ggplot2, dplyr...
## $ function_name <fct> library, aes, filter, mutate, ggplot, group...
## $ n             <int> 171, 123, 123, 122, 83, 62, 61, 59, 41, 38,...

{% endhighlight %}

We can visualize this data using `ggplot2`. We chose a lollipop style chart that extends lengthwise for the top 20, which shows off the number and percentage of total for each of the top 20 functions. We can see that `base::library()`, `ggplot2::aes()`, `dplyr::filter()`, and `dplyr::mutate()` are very frequently used by DRob. In fact, these four functions comprise 23.3% of his total functions. Unfortunately, `aes()` can't be used alone (see below for how it's used with the `ggplot()` function). __However, with knowledge of `library()` and the combination of `filter()` and `mutate()` from `dplyr`, a learner can understand 18% of DRob's code!__


{% highlight r %}
ve_functions_top_20_tbl %>%

#### Which Packages Are Most Frequently Used by DRob? <a class="anchor" id="q2"></a>

We can answer this question a number of ways, and we elect to make a time-based analysis to expose underlying trends within packages over time. The idea is that some packages may be used more frequently for specific reasons, and we aim to uncover the true trend of the packages which is not constant. We'll use the `tibbletime` package to help out with the time-based analysis by aggregating (or grouping) the data by six-month intervals. Note that we lump (using `fct_lump()`) all packages into six categories based on the top 5 packages and an extra column called "Other". a label is made by pasting "H" with `semester(date)` to return the which half of the year the data is aggregated. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_package_frequency_tbl <- variance_explained_tbl %>%
    select(date, package, function_name) %>%
    mutate(package = as.factor(package) %>% fct_lump(n = 5, other_level = "Other")) %>%
    arrange(date) %>%
    as_tbl_time(index = date) %>%
    collapse_by(period = "6 m", clean = TRUE) %>%
    count(date, package) %>%
    count_to_pct(date) %>%
    mutate(biannual = paste0("H", semester(date))) 
    
ve_package_frequency_tbl %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 47
## Variables: 5
## $ date     <date> 2015-01-01, 2015-01-01, 2015-01-01, 2015-01-01,...
## $ package  <fct> base, ggplot2, stats, Unknown, Other, base, dply...
## $ n        <int> 22, 28, 2, 20, 6, 19, 8, 32, 7, 12, 17, 131, 110...

{% endhighlight %}

Next, we can visualize with `ggplot2`. __The total functions (column `n` in `ve_package_frequency_tbl`) used are misleading since in some half years DRob posts less than in others__. We can normalize by switching to percentage of total functions by half year. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_package_frequency_tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, n, fill = package)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_text(aes(x = date, y = n, label = biannual), 
              vjust = -1, color = palette_light()[[1]], size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ package, ncol = 3) +
    scale_fill_tq() +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(
        title = "Which Packages Are Most Frequently Used by DRob?",
        subtitle = "Variance Explained Blog",
        x = "Date (Bi-Annual Aggregation)", y = "Count of R Functions (n)"
    )
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-21](/figure/source/2018-03-03-how_to_learn_R_pt1/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)

We switch to a percentage of total functions (`pct` column in `ve_package_frequency_tbl`) to get a better perspective on what trends are happening within posts over time. We see that DRob is trending in the direction of more `dplyr` and `ggplot2` and using fewer "Unknown" packages, which are packages that I do not have currently loaded on my machine (e.g. not "tidyverse" or "base"). It's clear that `base`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2` are DRob's toolkits of choice. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_package_frequency_tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, pct, fill = package)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_text(aes(x = date, y = pct, label = biannual), 
              vjust = -1, color = palette_light()[[1]], size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ package, ncol = 3) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_fill_tq() +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(
        title = "Which Packages Are Most Frequently Used by DRob?",
        subtitle = "Variance Explained Blog",
        x = "Date (Bi-Annual Aggregation)", y = "% of Total R Functions [n / sum(n)]"
    )
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-22](/figure/source/2018-03-03-how_to_learn_R_pt1/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)

Finally, we can get the overall percentage of package usage by `uncount`ing and recounting by package. We add a cumulative percentage column and see that we can almost get to 80% with just three package: `dplyr`, `base`, and `ggplot2`. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_package_frequency_tbl %>%
    uncount(weights = n) %>%
    count(package) %>%
    count_to_pct() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    mutate(pct_cum = cumsum(pct)) %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



|package |   n|       pct|   pct_cum|
|:-------|---:|---------:|---------:|
|dplyr   | 634| 0.2739844| 0.2739844|
|base    | 627| 0.2709594| 0.5449438|
|ggplot2 | 535| 0.2312014| 0.7761452|
|Other   | 254| 0.1097666| 0.8859118|

#### How "Tidy" Is DRob's Code? <a class="anchor" id="q3"></a>

We saw in the package analysis that DRob is using quite a few "tidy" packages. We can extend the analysis to see how frequently he's using "tidyverse" functions. 

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a very popular set of packages that are developed specifically to do data science in an integrated and easy to understand way. Currently, the "tidyverse" consists of the following packages:


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_packages(include_self = F)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##  [1] "broom"       "cli"         "crayon"      "dplyr"      
##  [5] "dbplyr"      "forcats"     "ggplot2"     "haven"      
##  [9] "hms"         "httr"        "jsonlite"    "lubridate"  
## [13] "magrittr"    "modelr"      "purrr"       "readr"      
## [17] "readxl\n(>=" "reprex"      "rlang"       "rstudioapi" 
## [21] "rvest"       "stringr"     "tibble"      "tidyr"      
## [25] "xml2"
{% endhighlight %}

We can flag functions from the tidyverse package from DRob's code base using the `tidyverse_packages()` function. If functions are in a tidyverse package, the are flagged as "Yes" and otherwise "No".


{% highlight r %}
ve_tidiness_tbl <- variance_explained_tbl %>%
    select(date, function_name, package) %>%
    mutate(tidy_function = case_when(
        package %in% tidyverse_packages() ~ "Yes", 
        TRUE ~ "No"))

ve_tidiness_tbl %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 2,314
## Variables: 4
## $ date          <date> 2018-02-04, 2018-02-04, 2018-02-04, 2018-0...
## $ function_name <chr> "library", "theme_set", "theme_light", "dir...

## $ tidy_function <chr> "No", "Yes", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "Ye...
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how easy it is to quickly see how tidy DRob is. About 60% of his functions are "tidyverse" functions.


{% highlight r %}
ve_tidiness_tbl %>%
    count(tidy_function) %>%
    count_to_pct() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



|tidy_function |    n|       pct|
|:-------------|----:|---------:|
|Yes           | 1373| 0.5933449|
|No            |  941| 0.4066551|

How has DRob's "tidiness" changed over time? We'll again call upon `tibbletime` to help transform the data using `collapse_by()`. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_tidiness_over_time_tbl <- ve_tidiness_tbl %>%
    select(date, tidy_function, function_name, package) %>%
    arrange(date) %>%
    as_tbl_time(index = date) %>%
    collapse_by(period = "6 m", clean = TRUE) %>%
    count(date, tidy_function) %>%
    count_to_pct(date) %>%
    filter(tidy_function == "Yes") %>%
    mutate(biannual = paste0("H", semester(date)))

glimpse(ve_tidiness_over_time_tbl)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 8
## Variables: 5
## $ date          <date> 2015-01-01, 2015-07-01, 2016-01-01, 2016-0...
## $ tidy_function <chr> "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "...
## $ n             <int> 29, 53, 189, 133, 310, 427, 140, 92
## $ pct           <dbl> 0.3717949, 0.5578947, 0.4921875, 0.5277778,...
## $ biannual      <chr> "H1", "H2", "H1", "H2", "H1", "H2", "H1", "H2"
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a fun fact... According to this graph, DRob is over twice as "tidy" now as when he started blogging in 2015. This should tell us that we really need to give the "tidyverse" a shot if we aren't using it now. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_tidiness_over_time_tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(date, pct)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = palette_light()[[1]], color = "white") +
    geom_text(aes(x = date, y = pct, label = biannual), 
              vjust = -1, color = palette_light()[[1]], size = 3) +
    geom_text(aes(x = date, y = pct, label = scales::percent(pct)), 
              vjust = 2, color = "white", size = 3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_fill_tq() +
    theme_tq() +
    labs(
        title = 'How "Tidy" Is DRobs Code?',
        subtitle = "Variance Explained Blog",
        x = "Date (Bi-Annual Aggregation)", y = "% of Total R Functions [n / sum(n)]"
    ) +
    expand_limits(y = 1)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Which Functions and Packages Should We Focus On For Learning R? <a class="anchor" id="q4"></a>

Now the million dollar question: What should we focus on if we are just starting out in R? We'll use the 80/20 Rule, which boils down to which top functions build 80% of DRob's code. Ideally this should be around 20% according to the rule. The question is actually really easy to answer using the `cumsum()` function from `base`. We can flag any cumulative percentages that are less than or equal to 80% as "high usage".


{% highlight r %}
ve_eighty_twenty_tbl <- variance_explained_tbl %>%
    count(package, function_name) %>%
    count_to_pct() %>%
    arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
    mutate(
        pct_cum = cumsum(pct),
        high_usage = case_when(
            pct_cum <= 0.8 ~ "Yes",
            TRUE ~ "No"
        )) 

ve_eighty_twenty_tbl %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 312
## Variables: 6
## $ package       <chr> "base", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "ggplo...
## $ function_name <chr> "library", "filter", "aes", "mutate", "ggpl...
## $ n             <int> 171, 123, 123, 122, 83, 62, 61, 59, 41, 38,...
## $ pct           <dbl> 0.073898012, 0.053154710, 0.053154710, 0.05...
## $ pct_cum       <dbl> 0.07389801, 0.12705272, 0.18020743, 0.23292...
## $ high_usage    <chr> "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "...
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we just count our high usage flags and turn the count to percent. We can see that 28.2% of functions create 80% of DRob's code. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_eighty_twenty_tbl %>%
    count(high_usage) %>%
    count_to_pct(col = nn) %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



|high_usage |  nn|       pct|
|:----------|---:|---------:|
|No         | 224| 0.7179487|
|Yes        |  88| 0.2820513|

Finally, here are the functions by package that we should focus on if we are just starting out. Keep in mind this is just DRob and we may want to expand to other masters of data science to get an even better picture of the high usage functions. 


{% highlight r %}
ve_eighty_twenty_tbl %>%
    filter(high_usage == "Yes") %>%
    split(.$package)
{% endhighlight %}

### Takeaways From DRob's Code

1. DRob is using quite a bit of `base`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2` code. __In fact, these three libraries account for 77.6% of his code on Variance Explained.__

2. DRob's code is getting... tidier! __DRob is using approximately 80% tidyverse code in the most recent half-year of blogging.__ This trend is increasing, although it will eventually top out. This compares to around 37% tidy code when he began blogging in 2015.

3. If DRob is getting tidier, which area is getting impacted the most? It's the packages I've categorized as "Unknown". These are non-tidyverse or pre-loaded packages. In other words, these are uncommonly used packages that may serve a specialized need. I do not currently have these loaded, which is why they are considered "Unknown". It's worth mentioning that `base` and `stats` libraries are declining slightly, but not to the extent that specialized packages are declining. __The bottom line - DRob is using less specialized packages and more tidyverse.__

### Analysis Risks

One point I have not discussed is that DRob is just one _really good_ data scientist. His code is clearly representative of the tidyverse-style, which resonates with many future data scientists coming into the industry. If one wishes to emulate DRob, this is probably a good analysis to take and run with. However, it may make sense to also view other "masters" that exist as part of a future endeavor. 

Another point is that we got 2,314 functions out of 58 posts. While this is by no means a small sample, we certainly may wish to increase the sample size to get more confidence in the most high usage functions. Personally, I'd like to see a 100X ratio between top functions and total observations, meaning the top 100 functions would be from at a minimum 10,000 functions. With that said, the analysis was performed accross a large sample of projects (58 posts less those that do not contain code) and multiple years which is another factor that improves confidence. 

## Bonus: How to Learn R by Analyzing Your Code <a class="anchor" id="bonus"></a>

We spoke a lot about analyzing DRob's code, but with a few modifications you can apply this analysis to your own code stored in .R or .Rmd files! Here's how with the `fs` package. 

We'll begin with a relatively large code base from a project I'm working on, which is a new course called __HR 201: Predicting Employee Attrition__. It's part of our brand new [Business Science University Virtual Workshop](#bsu), which will be released soon! This code base (directory containing R code) is not available to you, but you can follow along if you have a code base of .R or .Rmd files stored in a directory of your own. Just change the directory path to your own. 

### Part 1: Extracting Your Functions From Your Code Base

First, load the `fs` package. This is a great package for working with the file system on you computer. 


{% highlight r %}
library(fs)
{% endhighlight %}


Next, collect the path for YOUR code base directory. I will use my R Project directory for the HR 201 Course.


{% highlight r %}
dir_path <- "../../../Business Science/Courses/Teachable/HR201_Employee_Turnover_H2O/HR201_Employee_Turnover_Project/"
{% endhighlight %}

Use a function called `dir_info()` to retrieve the contents of the directory. Add the argument, `recursive = TRUE`, to collect all the files from the sub-directories. Use `head()` to return the first six rows only. 


{% highlight r %}
dir_info(dir_path, recursive = TRUE) %>% 
    head() %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



|path                                                                                                                                                   |type      |   size| permissions|modification_time   |user |group |  device_id| hard_links| special_device_id|        inode| block_size| blocks| flags| generation|access_time         |change_time         |birth_time          |

Now that we see how `dir_info()` works, we can use one more function called `path_file()` to retrieve just the file portion of the path. We can then use the file name with `str_detect()` to detect only files with ".R" or ".Rmd" at the end. We'll create a tibble of the file names and paths. 


{% highlight r %}
rmd_or_r_file_paths_tbl <- dir_info(dir_path, recursive = T) %>%
    mutate(file_name = path_file(path)) %>%
    select(file_name, path) %>%
    filter(str_detect(file_name, "(\\.R|\\.Rmd)$")) 

rmd_or_r_file_paths_tbl %>% knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we can create a custom function called, `build_function_names_tbl_from_file_path()`, which is very similar function to the url builder before. The main difference is that the HTML extraction code is replaced with `readLines()`.



{% highlight r %}
build_function_names_tbl_from_file_path <- function(path, loaded_functions_tbl) {
    
    builder <- function(path, loaded_functions_tbl) {
        readLines(path) %>%
            parse_function_names() %>%
            left_join(loaded_functions_tbl) %>%
            filter(
                !(function_name == "filter" & !(package == "dplyr"))
                ) %>%
            mutate(package = ifelse(is.na(package), "Unknown", package))
    }
    
    safe_builder <- possibly(builder, otherwise = NA)
    
    safe_builder(path, loaded_functions_tbl)
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can test it with one of the file paths.


{% highlight r %}
file_path_1 <- rmd_or_r_file_paths_tbl$path[[1]]
file_path_1
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] "../../../Business Science/Courses/Teachable/HR201_Employee_Turnover_H2O/HR201_Employee_Turnover_Project/00_Scripts/assess_attrition.R"
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see what it returns.  


{% highlight r %}
build_function_names_tbl_from_file_path(file_path_1, loaded_functions_tbl) %>%
    glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 57
## Variables: 2
## $ function_name <chr> "library", "count", "function", "quos", "en...
## $ package       <chr> "base", "dplyr", "base", "dplyr", "dplyr", ...
{% endhighlight %}

Great, it works identically to the web scraping version but with local file paths. We have 57 functions just in the first file.

We can scale it to all code in the code base using the file paths. The process is almost identical to the web scraping process. 


{% highlight r %}
local_function_names_tbl <- rmd_or_r_file_paths_tbl %>%
    mutate(
        function_name = map(path, build_function_names_tbl_from_file_path, loaded_functions_tbl),
        is_logical    = map_dbl(function_name, is.logical)
        ) %>%
    filter(is_logical != 1) %>%
    select(file_name, function_name) %>%
    unnest() %>%
    left_join(loaded_functions_tbl)

local_function_names_tbl %>% glimpse()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## Observations: 1,422
## Variables: 3
## $ file_name     <fs::path> "assess_attrition.R", "assess_attritio...
## $ function_name <chr> "library", "count", "function", "quos", "en...
## $ package       <chr> "base", "dplyr", "base", "dplyr", "dplyr", ...
{% endhighlight %}

### Part 2: Analyzing Your Code

You can run through the same process with your code. Here are my top 20 functions. 


{% highlight r %}
local_functions_top_20_tbl <- local_function_names_tbl %>%
    count(package, function_name) %>%
    count_to_pct() %>%
    arrange(desc(n)) %>%
    top_n(20) %>%
    rowid_to_column(var = "rank")

local_functions_top_20_tbl %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = n, y = fct_reorder(function_name, n), color = package)) +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = 0, yend = function_name), size = 2) +
    geom_point(size = 4) +
    geom_label(aes(label = paste0(function_name, "(), ", package, ", ", scales::percent(pct))), 
               hjust = "inward", size = 3.5) +
    expand_limits(x = 0) +
    labs(
        title = "Which Functions Are Most Frequently Used by DRob?",
        subtitle = "Variance Explained Blog",
        x = "Function Count (n)", y = "Count of R Functions (n)") +
    scale_color_tq() +
    theme_tq() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
{% endhighlight %}

#### Similarities

You can assess the similarities and differences between you and DRob. For example, DRob and I both use quite a bit of `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for visualization. 


{% highlight r %}
local_functions_top_20_tbl %>%
    filter(function_name %in% ve_functions_top_20_tbl$function_name) %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



| rank|package |function_name |  n|       pct|
|----:|:-------|:-------------|--:|---------:|
|    1|dplyr   |mutate        | 88| 0.0618847|
|    2|ggplot2 |aes           | 62| 0.0436006|
|    3|dplyr   |select        | 57| 0.0400844|
|    5|base    |library       | 35| 0.0246132|
|    7|ggplot2 |labs          | 34| 0.0239100|
|    9|ggplot2 |ggplot        | 27| 0.0189873|
|   11|base    |c             | 26| 0.0182841|
|   14|ggplot2 |geom_line     | 23| 0.0161744|
|   20|dplyr   |filter        | 18| 0.0126582|

#### Differences 

I have a few differences related to my coding techniques. I do quite a bit of programming so `base::function()` is in fourth place and `dplyr::enquo()` (part of the new [tidy eval](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html) framework) is in 15th place. I also have `tidyquant::palette_light()` and `tidyquant::theme_tq()` related to my preference for `tidyquant` ggplot2 themes. 


{% highlight r %}
local_functions_top_20_tbl %>%
    filter(!function_name %in% ve_functions_top_20_tbl$function_name) %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



| rank|package   |function_name |  n|       pct|
|----:|:---------|:-------------|--:|---------:|
|    4|base      |function      | 48| 0.0337553|
|    6|tidyquant |palette_light | 35| 0.0246132|
|    8|base      |as.factor     | 28| 0.0196906|
|   10|tidyquant |theme_tq      | 27| 0.0189873|
|   12|tibble    |as.tibble     | 26| 0.0182841|
|   13|forcats   |fct_relevel   | 24| 0.0168776|
|   15|dplyr     |enquo         | 20| 0.0140647|
|   16|base      |names         | 19| 0.0133615|
|   17|dplyr     |contains      | 19| 0.0133615|
|   18|dplyr     |glimpse       | 19| 0.0133615|
|   19|tibble    |glimpse       | 19| 0.0133615|

And, we can also see how DRob's top 20 differs from mine. Most of these functions are ones I use frequently, just not in my top 20. And, this is likely the case for DRob with the dissimilar functions in the table above.


{% highlight r %}
ve_functions_top_20_tbl %>%
    rowid_to_column(var = "rank") %>%
    filter(!function_name %in% local_functions_top_20_tbl$function_name) %>%
    knitr::kable()
{% endhighlight %}



| rank|package |function_name |  n|       pct|
|----:|:-------|:-------------|--:|---------:|
|    6|dplyr   |group_by      | 62| 0.0267934|
|    8|base    |sum           | 59| 0.0254970|
|    9|dplyr   |summarize     | 41| 0.0177182|
|   10|base    |mean          | 38| 0.0164218|
|   14|dplyr   |count         | 31| 0.0133967|
|   15|ggplot2 |geom_point    | 30| 0.0129646|
|   16|ggplot2 |facet_wrap    | 30| 0.0129646|
|   17|dplyr   |inner_join    | 28| 0.0121003|
|   18|dplyr   |ungroup       | 25| 0.0108038|
|   19|dplyr   |arrange       | 25| 0.0108038|
|   20|broom   |tidy          | 24| 0.0103717|




## Conclusions

We are half-way on our quest to develop an optimal strategy on how to learn R. We picked a great candidate in DRob to learn from. He's a tidyverse afficianado, a master data scientist, and he has a large sample of blog posts spanning multiple years to aggregate and analyze. 

We learned a bunch of cool things related to our hypothesis. To recap, we hypothesized that (1) you don't need to learn everything to become proficient at R, and (2) we can develop a strategic plan by learning from a master data scientist. We have not proven the second point yet, but the first we can confirm with confidence given that 88 functions created 80% of the output on DRob's blog. 

In the next post we'll dive deeper into the list of top functions generated to see if we can develop a program to go from zero experience in R to intermediate status quickly! __If our 80/20 theory is right, we should be able to go from zero to intermediate in just a couple weeks by focusing on the most critical functions__.
