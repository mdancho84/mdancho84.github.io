Data Science and Machine Learning in business begins with R. Why? R is the premier language that enables ___rapid exploration, modeling, and communication___ in a way that no other programming language can match: __SPEED!__ This is why you need to learn R. Time is money, and, in a world where you are measured on productivity and skill, R is your machine-learning powered productivity booster. 

In this __Data Science With R Course Series__, we’ll cover what life is like in our ground-breaking, enterprise-grade course called [Data Science For Business With R (DS4B 201-R)](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover/?coupon_code=DS4B15). The objective is to experience the qualities that make R great for business by following a real-world data science project. We review the course that will take you to advanced in __10 weeks__.

In this article, we’ll cover [Week 3: Data Understanding](#week3), which is where we expand our exploratory techniques with the goal of exposing key characteristics of the features in our data set.

But, first, a quick recap of our trajectory and the course overview.

## Week 3: Data Understanding {#week3}

In data understanding, you’ll learn two key packages that can help identify characteristics of your data:

<ol>
    <li>`skimr`: For efficiently exploring data by data type (e.g. numeric, character, etc)</li>
    <li>`GGally`: For visualizing pair plots for many features within the data</li>
</ol>

Let’s take a peek at the course.

<br/>
### EDA with skimr

We kick week 3 off with `skimr`, a package for quickly skimming data by data type. In the course you’ll review both numeric data and character data. This is important to identify quickly what issues may be present such as missing values, numeric data that should be categorical, and so on. 

Here’s a snapshot of our first use of the `skim()` function.

</p>

<br/>
### EDA with GGally

Next, we build our knowledge of the data by making use of the GGally package for visually identifying relationships in the data. We focus on identifying relationships between the target (employee attrition) and various features in the data set. We make use of the `ggpairs()` function that enables us to visualize the complex relationships.

Next, you’ll build a custom plotting function with `Tidy Eval` (learned in Week 2) to extend the functionality of `ggpairs()` and enable honing in on the relationship between each feature and its interaction with attrition.

We end Week 3 with the second Challenge.

<br>
### Challenge #2

In Challenge 2, you’ll use your custom plotting function `plot_ggpairs()` to investigate many complex relationships. You’ll combine features into logical groups based on business knowledge and then visualize the grouped features together to explore their complex relationships to attrition.

## Next Up

The next article in the ___Data Science With R Series___ covers Data Preprocessing. We’ll learn about an awesome package called `recipes` that enables preprocessing workflows. We’ll focus on two aspects of data preparation:

<ol>
    <li>Preparing data for people </li>
    <li>Preparing data for machines</li>
</ol>
