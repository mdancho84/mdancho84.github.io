In a world where you have __Limited Time__ and __Endless Options__, what are the MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS that contribute to a successful Data Science Transformation?

# Your Transformation Has 2 Things Going Against It

We have limited time and endless options. Limited time is a bad thing. Endless options is also a bad thing. Here's why.

## Limited Time

The longer you take to learn something, the less impact you have on your organization, and the less potential to grow in your career.

You need to learn high-impact, value-adding tools quickly. Further, you don't just need to learn them. You need to __learn how to APPLY THE TOOLS.__

## Endless Options

At first glance, this seems like a good thing. We have options - Yay!

But it's actually a bad thing. Here's why.

Say you walk into an Ice Cream shop, and on the wall they have 25 flavors and 10 toppings. You get to pick 1 Flavor and 2 Toppings.

__THIS RESULTS IN 2,250 COMBINATIONS!!!__

It would take a normal person hours to contemplate each combination and decide a path forward. This is a problem - and we're just talking ice cream cones. 

Now, factor in something as important as Data Science Education, and you can see that endless options is a bad thing. 


# What Can You Do To Ensure Success?

#### 1. Pick a program that focuses on applying data science to business applications.

This means a program that connects data science to the business using systems, frameworks, cheat sheets, and resources that are <strong><u>REPEATABLE</u></strong>. (You need to be able to repeat what you learn).

#### 2. Pick a program that shows you how to learn fast.

This means a program that doesn't teach you everything, but rather teaches you the __20% of things that will solve 80% of your business applications.__



# Which Data Science Program Should You Choose?

This graphic weights Data Science Education Programs on the __2 most important metrics__ that are __critical to your data science transformation__:

1. The Way the Program Connects Data Science To Business Applications

2. How Quickly the Program Gets You Applying Data Science To Real Business Problems

It turns out that I designed Business Science to excel in these 2 CRITICAL metrics. Here's the Combined Score:

- __Business Science = 20__
- Coursera = 10
- DataCamp = 5


### My Struggle

I saw a gap in data science education while I was learning. I struggled using the available programs. I tried Coursera, I tried Udemy, ...

### Nothing Worked

I began developing an R package called tidyquant, and it was through this project where I learned more than any course I ever took. 

### Applying The Tools Through A Project Worked!

I exponentially increased my learning through 1 project because I had to apply and integrate 15+ data science tools.

Overnight, I was able to build my skills and learn data science. 
 
<h4 style="background-color:#fff1ce; padding:14px;">I Built A System For You That Improves The Project-Based Learning Approach</h4>

The __Project-Based Learning Approach__ was key, but there were several other factors that helped to:

#### 80/20 Tools 
Don't teach everything, teach what I really use. Teach what gets results 80% of the time (or more).

#### Mentorship
Provide a way to connect you to me and others. You will have questions. Having access to the instructor and others in the course when you get stuck is critical.

#### Repeatable Methods 
Process trumps all, when you leave the course you better have a repeatable methodology that you can implement


# Does This Feel Like You?

Did you answer yes to any of these?

1. You are busy and need to learn fast

2. You've tried everything

3. You feel like nothing works

If you've answered yes to ANY of these, then Business Science is for you. 


# What Results Can You Expect?

Here are examples of what REAL STUDENTS are experiencing:
