We've just added a _new course_ to our __Learning Labs PRO__ service: [__Building API's with `plumber` and `Postman`__](https://university.business-science.io/p/learning-labs-pro). You learn how to build API's from 2 Real World examples:

1. ___Stock Portfolio Optimization___ - Create an API that optimizes a basket of stocks into an optimal portfolio.

2. ___FIFA 2019 Player Values___ - Create an API that predicts football (soccer) player values based on age, nationality, and FIFA ranking. 



## Plumber API Course - You Create This Optimized Portfolio API

You create an API using `plumber` and `Postman` that solves a real-world problem: ___Stock Optimization___! This API handles a `POST` request with `JSON` format stocks. Add any number of stocks, and the output optimizes the portfolio by the combination that yields the best Sharpe Ratio.
