## Tools And Techniques Used

We'll apply the following tools and techniques using a real-world problem:

- __Business Science Problem Framework__ for data science project management

- __Costing attrition__ and developing data science code workflows in R

- __H2O__ for automated machine learning (AutoML)

- __LIME__ for black-box model feature explanation

- __Correlation Analysis__ for pre-modeling feature importance

- __Recommendation Logic__ for assisting executives and managers with data-driven decision-making

- `recipes` for preprocessing data for machine learning algorithms

- `GGally` and `skimr` for exploratory data analysis

- __Tidy Eval__ for programming in the `tidyverse`

- And more!

There's a lot that HR 201 offers.
