Here's a common situation, you're company has **LOTS OF WORD FILES**.

They contain tables of information that look like this:

<br>
Thinking like a programmer, you can extract this data using officer:

<br>
With a little bit of data wrangling with the tidyverse, you've got your table extracted & formatted:

Then you use ggplot2 to make a sweet plot:

Whoa - Look at 201! Getting a high "Activity Ratio" - Ratio of Lessons completed to Number of Students Enrolled:
