# Why Making Microsoft Word Reports from R is a Must

Listen, there's one way to __immediately turn off an executive...__

And that's by giving them a Jupter Notebook (I mean look at this mess). 

![Don't Use Jupyter for Executives](/assets/officedown_dont_use_jupyter.png)

<p class="date text-center">Please don't send Executives reports that look like this.</p>

Nothing against those that use Jupyter Notebooks to make their analysis. 

But, if you sent one of those to me (and I'm an executive that's used to reading reports in Microsoft Office formats like Excel and Word)...

### ...Then I'm going to immediately hit my Email Trash Icon (and probably not tell you.)

How does that make you feel?

You just spent days on a report. And guess what, it's not getting read. 

### Well let's fix that by learning how to making Microsoft Word Reports today. 

# Thank You to the Developer (and Community).

# Tutorial: Make Microsoft Word Reports with `officedown`

Here's how to use `officedown` to start make a professional Word Report. 

## Step 1: Make an Rmarkdown document 

Start by making a normal Rmarkdown document. Go to File > New File > R Markdown.

![Make RMD File](/assets/officedown_01_make_rmd.jpg)

## Step 2: Enable Officedown

Enable officedown as the Rmarkdown Output.

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

## Step 3: Setup the document's global `knitr` options

Use these `knitr` options to let `officedown` format the table and figure captions.

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

## Step 4: Add Table of Contents

The `block_toc()` function allows the Word Table of Contents to be generated.

Here's what the Table of Contents looks like.

## Step 5: Add Figures

This is where you start building the core of your report. Officedown integrates:

* Hyperlinked Figure Captioning using `\@ref(fig:fig_id)`
* Knitr Options like `fig.id` to connect the linked references to the figures
* Just add R Code inside of the Rmarkdown chunks like you would normally

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

Here's what it looks like in the report:

## Step 5: Add Tables

The last step is adding tables in your document.

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

And here's what it looks like in the Word Report.
