_Thanks to Matt and what I've learned so far, I was able do do an in-depth analysis of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) data, following his Business Science Process Framework and complete the project using RMarkdown. The polished, finished product impressed the hiring manager so much, he was willing to fast-track an offer."_
-Jennifer Cooper, VP Strategic Analytics

Jennifer Cooper  has started her new role as a VP of Strategic Analytics at a major bank.

During the interview process, Jennifer found herself in a multiple offer situation before selecting the best offer for her!  Congrats Jennifer, we LOVE hearing that!

One of the offers was due to her highly polished RMarkdown she created as a take-home exam.  Although the fast-tracked offer was not the job she ultimately took, a multiple offer scenario is the leverage we all dream of!



## Jennifer Had Been Trying to Learn Programming Through Other Courses First

_"Before discovering Business Science University, I knew I wanted to take R but had already committed to learning Python and signed up for several courses. So I waited, thinking it would be too much to try to learn R at the same time or - worse - that I had to pick one programming language and stick to it._

_Boy was I wrong. Talk about a "Wow, I could have had a V8 moment"!  Looking back, if I knew then what I know now, I would have taken R first!! Not just any R course, though -- Matt Dancho's Business Science R course(s). Matt's teaching style, combined with his project-based approach to solving real-world business problems and his genuine interest in his students' success make his courses a game-changer!_

_I've had some good instructors on different learning platforms, but none have taken the personal interest that Matt has to make sure I get the help and encouragement I need  to ensure I can apply the knowledge I'm gaining like him._

_For example, when I was concerned about taking R so soon after Python, Matt took the time to get to know me and my career path, providing an in-depth assessment / insights into how I could use R to address financial use cases more efficiently, even sharing his own, similar story. It was eye-opening!"_

## What Did Jennifer Learn Through Business Science?

<i>"Since then, I've taken <a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r">"DS4B 101"</a> and am currently taking <a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover">"DS4B201"</a>. I'm not going to lie, it has been challenging, particularly with a full-time job, but it has been worth every penny and hour I've spent! Recently, I decided I wanted to pursue new job opportunities, that would allow me to continue to grow my analytical skills and allow me to put what I'm learning into practice, and I was asked to do a take home-test in R.

Thanks to Matt and what I've learned so far, I was able do do an in-depth analysis of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) data, following his Business Science Process Framework and complete the project using RMarkdown.

The polished, finished product impressed the hiring manager so much, he was willing to fast-track an offer. In fact, as luck would have it, I ended up in a multiple-offer situation and have recently started a VP-level analytics role with a major bank.

Matt's courses have given me the self-confidence and inspiration to take my natural curiosity anywhere I want to go. I feel so blessed that I met him at DataScienceGo in 2018! His support and what he's taught me have had a major impact on my life! I really look forward to continuing to take other courses in his program!"</i>
