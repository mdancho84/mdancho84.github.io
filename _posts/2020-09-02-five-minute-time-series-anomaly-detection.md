# Have 5-Minutes? <br><small>Then let's learn Time Series Anomaly Detection</small>

__Anomaly detection__ is an important part of time series analysis:

1. Detecting anomalies can signify special events
2. Cleaning anomalies can improve forecast error

In this short tutorial, we will cover the `plot_anomaly_diagnostics()` and `tk_anomaly_diagnostics()` functions for visualizing and automatically detecting anomalies at scale. 


{% include cta_rtrack.html %}


# Let's Get Started

First setup the libraries we'll use:

{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)
library(timetk)
{% endhighlight %}


# Data

This tutorial will use the `walmart_sales_weekly` dataset: 

- Weekly
- Sales spikes at various events 

{% highlight r %}
walmart_sales_weekly
{% endhighlight %}

# Automatic Anomaly Detection

To get the data on the anomalies, we use `tk_anomaly_diagnostics()`, the preprocessing function. 

The `tk_anomaly_diagnostics()` method for anomaly detection implements a 2-step process to detect outliers in time series.

#### Step 1: Detrend & Remove Seasonality using STL Decomposition

The decomposition separates the "season" and "trend" components from the "observed" values leaving the "remainder" for anomaly detection.

The user can control two parameters: frequency and trend.

1. `.frequency`: Adjusts the "season" component that is removed from the "observed" values.
2. `.trend`: Adjusts the trend window (t.window parameter from `stats::stl()` that is used.

The user may supply both .frequency and .trend as time-based durations (e.g. "6 weeks") or numeric values (e.g. 180) or "auto", which predetermines the frequency and/or trend based on the scale of the time series using the `tk_time_scale_template()`.

#### Step 2: Anomaly Detection

Once "trend" and "season" (seasonality) is removed, anomaly detection is performed on the "remainder". Anomalies are identified, and boundaries (recomposed_l1 and recomposed_l2) are determined.

The Anomaly Detection Method uses an inner quartile range (IQR) of +/-25 the median.

IQR Adjustment, alpha parameter

With the default alpha = 0.05, the limits are established by expanding the 25/75 baseline by an IQR Factor of 3 (3X). The IQR Factor = 0.15 / alpha (hence 3X with alpha = 0.05):

- To increase the IQR Factor controlling the limits, decrease the alpha, which makes it more difficult to be an outlier.
- Increase alpha to make it easier to be an outlier.
- The IQR outlier detection method is used in `forecast::tsoutliers()`.
- A similar outlier detection method is used by Twitter's AnomalyDetection package.
- Both Twitter and Forecast tsoutliers methods have been implemented in Business Science's anomalize package.

# Anomaly Visualization

Using the `plot_anomaly_diagnostics()` function, we can interactively detect anomalies at scale. 

The `plot_anomaly_diagnostics()` is a visualtion wrapper for `tk_anomaly_diagnostics()` group-wise anomaly detection, implementing the 2-step process from above.

{% highlight r %}
walmart_sales_weekly %>%
  group_by(Store, Dept) %>%
  plot_anomaly_diagnostics(Date, Weekly_Sales, .facet_ncol = 2)
{% endhighlight %}
