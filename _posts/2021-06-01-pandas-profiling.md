# What is Pandas Profiling?

`Pandas Profiling` is an awesome python package for __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)__. It extends pandas for statistical summaries including correlations, missing values, distributions, and descriptive statistics. It's great for understanding Data Quality too!

# Before we get started, get the Python Cheat Sheet

`Pandas Profiling` is great for exploring data. But, you'll still need to learn how to wrangle data with `pandas` and visualize data with `plotnine`. For those topics, I'll use the [Ultimate Python Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/python-cheatsheet.html) to refer to `pandas` and `plotnine` code in my workflow.

### Quick Example:

[Download the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/python-cheatsheet.html) __Then Click the "Pandas Profiling" on Page 2__, which opens the Pandas Profiling Documentation.

<br>

Now you're ready to quickly reference `Pandas Profiling` functions.

Onto the tutorial. 

# How Pandas Profiling Works


Pandas profiling is super simple to run. Simply:

1. Import Packages
2. Read data
3. Run the `ProfileReport()`

</p>


This generates the Pandas Profiling Report.

# Getting Insights from the Pandas Profiling Report

Let's quickly pan to the "Correlation" Report Section. We can see that there is a negative correlation between Fuel Economy (mpg) and Engine Horsepower. __But how to we explore this negative relationship further?__

# Plotnine to the Rescue <br><small>ggplot2 for Python Users</small>

We can use `plotnine` to quickly make a visualization using `geom_point()` and `geom_smooth()`. This highlights the relationship and showcases that its nonlinear. It drops fast initially but beyond 150 HP the horsepower stabilizes.

# Why Learning plotnine is essential

I wouldn't be nearly as effective as a data scientist without knowing `plotnine`. In fact, data visualization has been one of two skills that have been critical to my career (with the other one being data transformation).



## Career Tip: <span style='color:#18bc9c;'>Learn plotnine</span>

If I had one piece of advice, it would be to start learning `plotnine`. Let me explain.

![Plotnine Logos](/assets/2021-06-01-pandas-profiling/plotnine_logos.jpg)

Learning `plotnine` in Python (and `ggplot2` in R) helped me to:

- __Explain complex topics__ to non-technical people
- __Develop good reports__ that showcased important points visually
- __Make persuasive arguments__ that got the attention of Senior Management and even my CEO

So, yes, learning `plotnine` / `ggplot2` was absolutely essential to my career. I received many promotions and got the attention of my CEO using `plotnine` effectively.

If you'd like to learn `plotnine` and data science for business, then read on. ðŸ‘‡



# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn data science. And I made a lot of mistakes.  I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

__If you feel like this, you're not alone.__

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. __Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught smartly__

2. __Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.__

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning Python and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will __get you past your struggles__ and improve your career in the process. 

It's called the [Python for Data Science Automation](https://university.business-science.io/p/python-for-data-science-automation-ds4b-101p). It's an integrated course that teaches you Python by integrating tools and solving real business problems.

![Tool Integration](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/kcmYQ8jnTO6OF7fHg0QP)

The result is that __you break through previous struggles__, learning from my experience & our community of 2000+ data scientists that are ready to help you succeed. You'll learn a ton going through our Business Process Automation project.
