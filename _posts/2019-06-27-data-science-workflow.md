Data Science is often misunderstood by students seeking to enter the field, business analysts seeking to add data science as a new skill, and executives seeking to implement a data science practice. This article aims to clear up the mystery behind data science by illustrating the sequence of steps to go from a business problem to generating business value using a data science workflow. __Once data science is understood, we can take steps to learn data science skills that will generate the most value and/or better make strategic investments in building a data science practice.__


# Overview

In this article, you will:

- Understand what data science is
- Learn how data science generates value for an organization
- Learn how to go from business problem to business value
- Get Special Offer to learn data science for business through <a href="https://university.business-science.io/">Business Science University</a>


# The Mystery & Confusion

Data Science is a mysterious term to many, but why?

### Students &amp; Data Enthusiasts

__People excited about data science see it as machine learning - 100% of the time__ (this is drastically disproportionate to reality). In reality, Machine Learning (or Modeling) is about __5% of your time__. The rest of the time is spent:

- __Understanding the Business Problem:__ Communicating with Domain Experts (20%)
- __Working with Data:__ Cleaning, Manipulating, Visualizing, Processing, Transforming, and Understanding (60%)
- __Communicating Results:__ Reporting, Slide Decking, and Building Distributed Applications (Predictive Decision-Making Tools) (15%)

### Executives &amp; Business Professionals

__Executives and business professionals__ see data science as a new technology that could benefit their organization, but the connection between business problem and business value is not well understood. Data Science is often viewed as Artificial Intelligence (AI), a complex, black-box technology that is very trendy. But, the question remains - _"What Can AI Do?"_

### Reality for Everyone

Fortunately, the reality is that large businesses:

- __Have many customers__ - The customers churn, generate sales, drive forecasts
- __Make many products and/or services__ - The products are linked to quality, lead time, and inventory
- __Have many suppliers__ - The suppliers affect lead times and serviceability
- __Have data__ - The data provides a means to measure business drivers and is the fuel for data science

This combination of business-drivers - customers, products, inventory, suppliers, and more - with a wide array of internal and external data available __makes data science a competitive advantage__ to organizations that can effectively implement it.


# Making Better Decisions Generates Business Value

The __goal__ for any Data Science Practice (Data Science Team) is to enable the rest of the organization to __make better, data-driven decisions__. Therefore, a Data Science Practice is a support role (similar to IT) that allows the organization to function better. The Data Science team can add a lot of value very quickly - through better decision making.

A simple example illustrates my point - __An organization that does $500M in annual revenue but has a customer churn rate of 10% loses out on $50M in revenue/year.__ If a data science practice can identify the issue, predict which customers are going to churn, and implement strategies that enable the workforce to targe the customers with retention strategies, the team can effectively reduce the churn rate 20%.

<h4><i>An organization that does $500M in annual revenue but has a customer churn rate of 10% loses out on $50M in revenue/year.</i></h4>
</p>
</center>
<br>

In monetary terms, __a reduction in churn of 20% equates to an annual savings of $10M__. Over 5 years, this is $50M in savings generated from the Data Science Practice working with the decision makers (e.g. Sales, Marketing, Production).


# How Do We Go From Business Problem To Business Value?

The way to go from business problem to business value follows an iterative set of steps that at [Business Science University](https://university.business-science.io), we call the Data Science Workflow:

<img src="/assets/2019-06-27-data-science-workflow/the-data-science-workflow.jpeg" alt="The Data Science Workflow">

The __Data Science Workflow__ has milestones (blue clouds), stages (dotted lines), and steps (gray shapes).

We begin with a __Business Problem__ (milestone), where the team or organization identifies a problem that is worth solving. Typically this has a specific metric assigned to it that can be measured financially (e.g. 10% of our customers are not re-purchasing each year, this is costing the organization $50M annually).

The organization prioritizes this problem with the data science team, and they step into a project management workflow. Hopefully the organization follows a systematic and repeatable approach designed to integrate the business with data science such as the <a href="https://www.business-science.io/bspf.html">Business Science Problem Framework</a> (we teach the BSPF in our <a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover">Data Science for Business with R Course (DS4B 201-R)</a>).

# 3 Stages of the Data Science Workflow

<img src="/assets/2019-06-27-data-science-workflow/the-data-science-workflow-preview.jpeg" alt="The Data Science Workflow">

There are 3 stages:

1. __Preparation__ - Data is collected and cleaned. This takes a significant amount of time because most data is unclean, meaning steps need to be taken to improve the quality and develop it into a format that machines can interpret and learn from.
2. __Experimentation__ - This is where hypotheses are generated, data is visualized, and models are generated. This takes significantly less time than Preparation.
3. __Distribution__ - Reports are generated documenting results, slide decks are created to present to management, and once management provides the go-ahead, apps are developed to implement decision making systems.

At the end of the workflow, data scientist’s call this “production” or “deployment”, and this is where __Business Value__ (milestone) is generated.

# Best Data Science Teams Focus on These Parts

The __best data science teams__ can iterate through this process going from problem to value very efficiently, spending little time on modeling and maximum time at the ends of the spectrum:

- __Beginning of Workflow:__ Business Understanding / Domain Expert Communication, Data Understanding, Data Quality, and Feature Engineering are Critical

- __End of Workflow:__ Communication with Project Stakeholders, Product Delivery are Critical

# References to Data Science Methodologies

Several other data science workflow and project management methodologies exist. The two that we use at _Business Science University_ are:

- CRISP-DM
- BSPF Framework

### CRISP-DM

The ___[CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) - Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining___ - Is a general approach to performing data science projects. It's cross-industry, which means it is compatible with almost any data science problem. One issue is that CRISP-DM is very general, which is why _Business Science_ created the ___BSPF Framework (discussed next)___. 

<p class="text-center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/2019-06-27-data-science-workflow/CRISP-DM_Process_Diagram.png" alt="Business Science Problem Framework" width="66%"></a></p>

<p class="date text-center"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining">CRISP-DM Framework</a></p>

### BSPF Framework

The [Business Science Problem Framework](/bspf.html) modifies the CRISP-DM process to provide specific strategies that improve project productivity and help data scientists get results in terms of Return-On-Investment (ROI).
