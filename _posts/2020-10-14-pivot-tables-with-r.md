# Excel Pivot Tables with R Tutorial

The biggest thing I missed when I transititioned from Excel to R was...
PIVOT TABLES! 

Seriously - Pivot Tables are so useful. You can summarize and reshape (aka Pivot) data so easily with them in Excel. Why not in R???

Here's the Publication-Quality Pivot Table that we are going to make today. ðŸ‘‡

<br>

First, collect your data using `tidyquant`, an awesome package I created for importing & working with **Financial Data**.

<br>

Next, make a `pivot_table()` from the stock data. The resulting data summarized using a **percentage change from 1st to last** in each pivot cell.

<br>

And with the GT Package, we can make the pivoted data into a **PUBLICATION-QUALITY Pivot Table with conditional formatting** applied to highlight years with positive stock returns. _(Table code partially shown. Get the GitHub code to reproduce the table.)_

<br>

And, now you have a publication-quality stock performance report! ðŸ‘‡

<br>

You've just made a publication-quality Pivot Table in R. 

Boom! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
