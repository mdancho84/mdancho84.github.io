# What is A/B Testing?

**A/B Testing** is a statistical method for comparing two groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.

## How is A/B Testing used in Marketing Analytics?

**A/B Testing is used commonly in Marketing Analytics** to determine if a marketing campaign is effective: 

- For example, a company may want to know if a marketing campaign is effective at **driving sales**. 
- To do this, they will **run an A/B Test** where they compare the sales of a group that was exposed to the marketing campaign (the treatment group) to the sales of a group that was not exposed to the marketing campaign (the control group). 
- If there is a **statistically significant difference** between the two groups and a **positive average treatment effect (ATE)**, then the company can conclude that the marketing campaign is effective at driving sales.
- And we can estimate the **Lift (the increase in sales)** that the marketing campaign drove.

## How to pick the right Statistical Test?

There are many different types of statistical tests that can be used for A/B Testing. The type of statistical test that you use depends on the type of data that you have. 

The following diagram shows the **different types of statistical tests** that can be used for A/B Testing and the selection process.

<p class="date text-center">Statistical Test Selection for A/B Testing!</p>

For our business case, we'll rely on a very common test: **The 2 sample T-Test**, which is used to compare the means of two groups.

For other types of A/B Testing, you may need to use a different type of statistical test depending on the metric you are interested in (e.g. conversion metrics, counts of page views, etc). The table above can be used as a guide to help you select the right statistical test for your A/B Testing needs.

## How to create an experiment?

To create an experiment, you need to have two groups of data: a treatment group and a control group.

- **The treatment group** is the group that is exposed to the marketing campaign.
- **The control group** is the group that is not exposed to the marketing campaign.

Now that we know what A/B Testing is and how it is used in Marketing Analytics, let's look at an example of how to do A/B Testing in R.

# Business Case: Hotel Bookings and Return on Adspend

In this example, you are part of the Data Science team working for an upscale hotel chain. 

![Statistical Test Selection](/assets/073_hotel.jpg)

**Your Mission:**
Your team has been tasked with developing an online experiment to use Google Ads to drive hotel bookings (the action of reserving a room at the hotel). We will use A/B Testing to determine if a marketing campaign is effective at driving hotel bookings.



# R Tutorial: A/B Testing in R

**Super Important:** We'll start by trying to answer these business questions that are relevant to our Hotel Bookings business case:

1. **Does Adspend increase bookings?**
2. **By how much? Was there a Return on Adspend (ROAS)?**

These questions drive our experiment setup and analysis (more on this in a minute).

**Get The Code:** You can follow along with the R code in the [R-Tips Newsletter](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website). All code is avaliable in R-Tip 073.

## Step 1: Load the Libraries and Data

![A/B Testing: Load the Libraries and Data](/assets/073_01_libraries.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 073 Folder)</a></p>

### Experiment Setup (Data Description):

When you load the data, it looks like this:

![A/B Testing: Data](/assets/073_01_data.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Data (In the R-Tip 073 Folder)</a></p>

The data contains the following columns:

- period = 0: Pre/Post Experiment, 1: During Experiment
- assigment = "control" part of the control group, "treatment" part of the treatment group
- treatment = 0: No Adspend, 1: Adspend
- geo: Segmentation was performed by geography (this is common in marketing experiments to track pre and post experiment performance)
- bookings: Target feature that we want to measure the effect of Adspend on
- cost: Adspend (the amount of money spent on the marketing campaign during the experiment period = 1) 

## Step 2: Visualize the Data

Next, we will visualize the aggregate bookings by period for the control and treatment group to see if we can spot any visual effect of the adspend.

- **The Pre-Intervention Period (Period = 0)** is from 2015-01-05 to 2015-02-15
- **The Post Intervention Period (Period = 1)** is from 2015-02-16 to 2015-03-15 (This is when the experiment was run)

### Data Visualization Code

Run this code to visualize the experiment:

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 073 Folder)</a></p>

### A/B Testing: Analyzing the Experiment Visually

The output is the following plot:

![A/B Testing: Visualize the Data](/assets/073_02_time_series_ab_test.jpg) 

We can see that it looks like there's a slight bump in bookings during the experiment period for the treatment group (the group that was exposed to the marketing campaign). But: 

1. It's hard to tell if this is a **statistically significant effect or just random noise.** 
2. It's hard to tell if there was a **return on adspend.**

To answer these questions, we'll need to run a statistical test.

## Step 3: Run the Statistical Test

Next, we'll run the statistical test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the control and treatment group.

### Split the data into pre and experiment periods

We'll just need the experiment period (period = 1) for the statistical test. So, we'll split the data into pre and experiment periods. Run this code:

![A/B Testing: Split the Data](/assets/073_03_split_the_data.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 073 Folder)</a></p>

### A/B Testing: Run the Statistical Test

Run this code to run the statistical test:

![A/B Testing: 2 Sample T-Test](/assets/073_03_2_sample_t_test_code.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 073 Folder)</a></p>

### A/B Testing: 2 Sample T-Test Results

The output is the following:

![A/B Testing: 2 Sample T-Test Results](/assets/073_03_results.jpg)

We can see that the:

- **estimated average treatment effect (ATE) is 96.2:** This means that on average each of the geo-segments saw an increase of $96.20 per booking-day during the experiment period (the period when the marketing campaign was run). This is good news. 

- **p-value is 0.0545:** Generally there is a 0.05 used as the cutoff. But this is a business decision. In this case, we see that the lower CI (confidence interval) around the ATE is -$1.87 and the upper CI is $194.00. So that gives me confidence that the ATE is likely positive.

### What could we be missing?

Sometimes there are other factors that can affect the results of an experiment. In this case, we may be missing the effect of seasonality. 

**For a more advanced tutorial on Uplift Modeling,** [See Part 2 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otb340lyiAQ&t=1942s) where I discuss how to use Meta (Facebook) `GeoLift` package on this problem. 

### Return on Adspend (ROAS)

We have answered the first question- Is there an effect? Yes, there is a statistically significant effect. At a 0.10 level, we can say that there is a statistically significant effect. **The Average Treatement Effect is $96.20.** 

But, we still need to answer the second question: **Was there a return on adspend (ROAS)?**

To answer this question, we need to calculate the ROAS.

### A/B Testing: Calculate the ROAS

Run this code to calculate the ROAS:

![A/B Testing: Calculate the ROAS](/assets/073_03_roas.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 073 Folder)</a></p>

### A/B Testing: ROAS Results

The output is the following:

![A/B Testing: ROAS Results](/assets/073_03_roas_results.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 073 Folder)</a></p>

We can see that the **Estimated ROAS is 2.67**. This means that for every dollar spent on the marketing campaign, we get $2.67 back in bookings.


# Conclusions:

We have answered the two questions that we set out to answer: 

1. **Does Adspend increase bookings?** Yes, there is a statistically significant effect. At a 0.10 level, we can say that there is a statistically significant effect. **The Average Treatement Effect is $96.20.**
2. **By how much? Was there a Return on Adspend (ROAS)?** Yes, there was a return on adspend. **The Estimated ROAS is 2.67.** This means that for every dollar spent on the marketing campaign, we get $2.67 back in bookings.

**However, there is A LOT more to becoming a Data Scientist for Business than just A/B Testing.**
