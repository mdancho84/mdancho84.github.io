Quantitative trading strategies are easy to develop in __R__ if you can manage the data workflow. In this post, I analyze every stock in the S&amp;P500 to screen in terms of __risk versus reward__. I'll show you how to use `quantmod` to collect daily stock prices and calculate log returns, `rvest` to web scrape the S&amp;P500 list of stocks from _Wikipedia_, `purrr` to map functions and perform calculations on nested tibbles (`tidyverse` data frames), and `plotly` to visualize risk versus reward and extract actionable information for use in your trading strategies. At the end, you will have a visualization that compares the entire set of S&amp;P500 stocks, and we'll screen them to find those with the best future prospects on a quantitative basis. As a bonus we'll investigate correlations to add diversification to your portfolio.  Finally, the code that generates the `plotly` and `corrplot` visualizations is made available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mdancho84/quantitative_stock_analysis_tutorial) for future stock screening. Whether you are a veteran trader or a newbie stock enthusiast, you'll learn a useful workflow for modeling and managing massive data sets using the `tidyverse` packages. And, the entire script runs in __less than five minutes__ so you can begin screening stocks quickly. 

Here's a sneak peek at the __interactive S&amp;P500 stock screening visualization__ that compares stocks based on growth (reward), variability (risk), and number of samples (risk). The tool can be used to visualize stocks with __good characteristics__: High growth (large mean log returns), low variability (low standard deviation), and high number of samples (lots of days traded). Make sure you __zoom in__ on sections of interest and __hover over the dots__ to gain insights.

Here's a sneak peek at the correlation analysis, which is __useful in determining which pairs of stocks to select to minimize risk__. These are the top 30 stocks according to high growth and low risk. The key here is to select a portfolio that minimizes the correlations between stocks, thus further minimizing risk. Select stocks with low correlation (i.e. small light blue dots indicate pairs have low correlation (good); large dark blue combinations indicate high correlation (bad)).

# Update <a class="anchor" id="update"></a>

  * __2016-10-29:__ An issue was uncovered due to stock splits. Stock splits cause a large decline in the stock performance, which penalizes the stocks that split by increasing the standard deviation of the daily returns. The fix is to use the adjusted stock prices. In addition to the fix, I expanded on the correlation section to include the top 30 stocks with high growth, low variability and high samples. Based on feedback, I also expanded the introduction to better explain the goals of the analysis and to include the key visualizations.

# Prerequisites <a class="anchor" id="prerequisites"></a>

For those following along in __R__, you'll need to load the following packages:


{% highlight r %}
library(quantmod)   # get stock prices; useful stock analysis functions
library(xts)        # working with extensible time series 
library(rvest)      # web scraping
library(tidyverse)  # ggplot2, purrr, dplyr, tidyr, readr, tibble
library(stringr)    # working with strings
library(forcats)    # working with factors
library(lubridate)  # working with dates in tibbles / data frames
library(plotly)     # Interactive plots
library(corrplot)   # Visuazlize correlation plots
{% endhighlight %}

If you don't have these installed, run `install.packages(pkg_names)` with the package names as a character vector (`pkg_names <- c("quantmod", "xts", ...)`).

# Stock Analysis: An Individual Stock <a class="anchor" id="sa-individual"></a>

Before we extrapolate to a __full-blown S&amp;P 500 Analysis__, we need to understand how to analyze a single stock. We'll walk through three steps to quickly get you up to speed on quantitatively analyzing stock returns:

1. [Exploring the Quantmod Package](#quantmod)
2. [Simulating Stock Prices](#sim)
3. [Understanding Drivers of the Simulation](#sim-drivers)


## Exploring the Quantmod Package <a class="anchor" id="quantmod"></a>

We'll use the `quantmod` package to retrieve and manipulate stock information. There's a lot of details behind `quantmod` and extensible timeseries (`xts`) objects, much of which is beyond the scope of this post. We'll skim the surface to get you to a proficient level. If you want to get to expert, a good resource is the University of Washington's [R Programming for Quantitative Finance](http://www.faculty.washington.edu/gyollin/docs/rFinancialData.pdf). We'll use [MasterCard](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA?p=MA), ticker symbol "MA", for the example.

### Quantmod Fundamentals

First, load the `quantmod` package and use the `getSymbols()` function to retrieve stock prices. I use the optional `from` and `to` arguments to limit the range of prices. 


{% highlight r %}
getSymbols("MA", from = "2007-01-01", to = "2016-10-23")
{% endhighlight %}

The `getSymbols()` function adds a variable to R's Global Environment with the stock ticker as the variable name. If you are using _RStudio_, check your _Environment_ tab, and you should see `MA`. What is `MA`? Informally, it's the daily stock prices and volumes. We need to understand it more formally. Send `MA` to the `class()` function using the pipe operator (`%>%`):


{% highlight r %}
MA %>% class()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] "xts" "zoo"
{% endhighlight %}

### xts Objects for Time Series

It turns out that `MA` is an `xts` object, which is a format conducive to manipulating timeseries. It plays nicely with and is an extension of the `zoo` package. The [xts vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/vignettes/xts.pdf) elaborates on the details, and another nice resource is the [R/Finance Workshop Presentation: Working with xts and quantmod](http://past.rinfinance.com/agenda/2009/xts_quantmod_workshop.pdf). Our priority is to understand the structure of the data. Pipe `MA` to the `str()` and `head()` functions to inspect.  


{% highlight r %}
MA %>% str()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## An 'xts' object on 2007-01-03/2016-10-21 containing:
##   Data: num [1:2470, 1:6] 99.5 96.9 101 99 101.1 ...
##  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
##   ..$ : NULL
##   ..$ : chr [1:6] "MA.Open" "MA.High" "MA.Low" "MA.Close" ...
##   Indexed by objects of class: [Date] TZ: UTC
##   xts Attributes:  
## List of 2
##  $ src    : chr "yahoo"
##  $ updated: POSIXct[1:1], format: "2016-10-30 09:53:43"
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
MA %>% head()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##            MA.Open MA.High MA.Low MA.Close MA.Volume MA.Adjusted
## 2007-01-03   99.55   99.68  95.63    96.41  26289000    9.241188
## 2007-01-04   96.90  101.85  95.30   101.14  27024000    9.694573
## 2007-01-05  100.99  102.20  99.00   101.06  29632000    9.686904
## 2007-01-08   99.01  102.25  99.00   101.08  16006000    9.688821
## 2007-01-09  101.10  105.75 100.60   105.74  36952000   10.135497
## 2007-01-10  105.62  106.50 103.00   104.74  35099000   10.048196
{% endhighlight %}

A couple observations:

* The index is a column of dates. This is different from data frames, which generally do not have row names and indicies are a sequence from `1:nrow`.
* The values are prices and volumes. We'll be working primarily the __adjusted price__ when graphing, since this removes the effect of stock splits.

### quantmod + xts

The `quantmod` package plays nicely with `xts` formatted objects. We can plot using the `quantmod::chartSeries()` function. Because of stock splits, I changed to use the adjusted prices with the `Ad()` function. For workflow purposes, I use the pipe (`%>%`) to get the adjusted prices first, and then send the adjusted prices to the chart function. I do this because it is easier to read and it makes complex actions simple to understand. You can also use `chartSeries(Ad(MA))`, but this is more difficult to understand.


{% highlight r %}
MA %>% 
    Ad() %>% 
    chartSeries()
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](/figure/source/2016-10-23-SP500_Analysis/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

The `chartSeries()` function has a number of options help visualize the stock performance. A few that I've added are:

  * `subset`: Isolated the year to 2015. This takes dates and ranges in `xts` subset format. Here's some tricks from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11871572/subsetting-tricks-for-xts-in-r).
  * `TA`: Added Bollinger Bands, Volume, and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) plots. These can also be added after the fact with add___() functions (e.g `addMACD()`). 
  * `theme`: Changed to a white theme.


{% highlight r %}
MA %>%
    chartSeries(TA='addBBands();
                    addBBands(draw="p");
                    addVo();
                    addMACD()', 
                subset='2016',
                theme="white"
                ) 
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7](/figure/source/2016-10-23-SP500_Analysis/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

The `quantmod` package includes functions to get daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual returns. We'll use `dailyReturn()` to get a `xts` object of daily returns (see `?periodReturn`, which is the base function). The default is an arithmetic return. Specify `type = "log"` if a logarithmic return is needed. We'll be dealing with log returns for [structural reasons](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-use-log-returns-of-stock-prices-for-autoregression).


{% highlight r %}
MA %>%
    Ad() %>%
    dailyReturn(type = 'log') %>% 
    head() 
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##            daily.returns
## 2007-01-03  0.0000000000
## 2007-01-04  0.0478957956
## 2007-01-05 -0.0007913742
## 2007-01-08  0.0001978765
## 2007-01-09  0.0450710700
## 2007-01-10 -0.0086507008
{% endhighlight %}

Although we just skim the surface of `quantmod` in this post, the package has a lot to offer for stock analysis (visit [www.quantmod.com](http://www.quantmod.com/) for more information). We'll primarily use it to retrieve stock prices (`getSymbols()`) and calculate log returns (`periodReturn(period = 'daily')`). Just keep in mind you can do a lot more with it.


## Simulating Stock Prices <a class="anchor" id="sim"></a>

The approach I use is similar to [rfortraders.com's](http://www.rfortraders.com/) [Lecture 6 - Stochastic Processes and Monte Carlo](http://www.rfortraders.com/lecture-6-stochastic-processes-and-monte-carlo/). The fundamental idea is that stock returns, measured daily, weekly, monthly, ..., are approximately __normally distributed__ and __uncorrelated__. As a result, we can theoretically model the behavior of stock prices within a confidence interval based on the stock's prior returns. 

### Returns are Normally Distributed

Applying the log-transformation, we can visually see that the daily returns are approximately normally distributed:


{% highlight r %}
MA_log_returns <- MA %>%
    Ad() %>%
    dailyReturn(type = "log")
names(MA_log_returns) <- "MA.Log.Returns"
# Plot the log-returns    
MA_log_returns %>%    
    ggplot(aes(x = MA.Log.Returns)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 100) + 
    geom_density() +
    geom_rug(alpha = 0.5) 
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](/figure/source/2016-10-23-SP500_Analysis/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)


We can examine the distribution of log returns by applying the `quantile()` function.


{% highlight r %}
probs <- c(.005, .025, .25, .5, .75, .975, .995)
dist_log_returns <- MA_log_returns %>% 
    quantile(probs = probs, na.rm = TRUE)
dist_log_returns
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##          0.5%          2.5%           25%           50%           75% 
## -0.0889592270 -0.0447154561 -0.0090748829  0.0009946221  0.0103051583 
##         97.5%         99.5% 
##  0.0474521137  0.0796786908
{% endhighlight %}

The median daily log return is 0.001 and the 95% confidence interval is between -0.0447 and 0.0475.

The __mean__ and __standard deviation__ of the daily log returns are:


{% highlight r %}
mean_log_returns <- mean(MA_log_returns, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_log_returns <- sd(MA_log_returns, na.rm = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight text %}
## Summary of log-returns:
##  Mean:   0.001 
##  StDev:  0.0225
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, to get the actual returns, we need to re-transform the log returns. Pipe the mean of the log returns (`mean_log_returns`) to `exp()`:


{% highlight r %}
mean_log_returns %>% exp()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] 1.000976
{% endhighlight %}

On average, the mean daily return is 0.0976% __more than__ the previous day's price. Doesn't sound like much, but it [compounds daily at an exponential rate](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp). 

### Random Walk

Since we have a mean and a standard deviation, we can simulate using a process called a [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk). We'll simulate prices for 1000 trading days. Keep in mind that every year has approximately [252 trading days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_day), so this simulation spans just under four years. 

The script below does the following: we start by specifying the number of random walks (`N`), the mean (`mu`), and the standard deviation (`sigma`). The script then simulates prices by progressively calculating a new price using a random return from the normal distribution characterized by `mu` and `sigma`, and multiplying it to the previous day's price. We then visualize the simulation.


{% highlight r %}
# Parameters
N     <- 1000
mu    <- mean_log_returns
sigma <- sd_log_returns
day <- 1:N
price_init <- MA$MA.Adjusted[[nrow(MA$MA.Adjusted)]]
# Simulate prices
set.seed(386) 
price  <- c(price_init, rep(NA, N-1))
for(i in 2:N) {
    price[i] <- price[i-1] * exp(rnorm(1, mu, sigma))
}
price_sim <- cbind(day, price) %>% 
    as_tibble()
# Visualize price simulation
price_sim %>%
    ggplot(aes(day, price)) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle(str_c("MA: Simulated Prices for ", N," Trading Days"))
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14](/figure/source/2016-10-23-SP500_Analysis/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

Bummer! It looks like we are going to lose money with this investment. Can we trust this simulation? 

_No_. The single random walk is just one of the many probabilistic outcomes. We need to __simulate many iterations to build confidence intervals__.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

[Monte-Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation does just that: we repeatedly perform the random walk simulation process hundreds or thousands of times. We'll perform 250 Monte Carlo simulations (`M = 250`) for one year of trading days simulations (`N = 252`).


{% highlight r %}
# Parameters
N     <- 252 # Number of Stock Price Simulations
M     <- 250  # Number of Monte Carlo Simulations   
mu    <- mean_log_returns
sigma <- sd_log_returns
day <- 1:N
price_init <- MA$MA.Adjusted[[nrow(MA$MA.Adjusted)]]
# Simulate prices
set.seed(123)
monte_carlo_mat <- matrix(nrow = N, ncol = M)
for (j in 1:M) {
    monte_carlo_mat[[1, j]] <- price_init
    for(i in 2:N) {
        monte_carlo_mat[[i, j]] <- monte_carlo_mat[[i - 1, j]] * exp(rnorm(1, mu, sigma))
    }
}
# Format and organize data frame
price_sim <- cbind(day, monte_carlo_mat) %>%
    as_tibble() 
nm <- str_c("Sim.", seq(1, M))
nm <- c("Day", nm)
names(price_sim) <- nm
price_sim <- price_sim %>%
    gather(key = "Simulation", value = "Stock.Price", -(Day))
# Visualize simulation
price_sim %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = Day, y = Stock.Price, Group = Simulation)) + 
    geom_line(alpha = 0.1) +
    ggtitle(str_c("MA: ", M, 
                  " Monte Carlo Simulations for Prices Over ", N, 
                  " Trading Days"))
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-15](/figure/source/2016-10-23-SP500_Analysis/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

We can get confidence intervals for the stock price at the end of the simulation using the `quantile()` function.


{% highlight r %}
end_stock_prices <- price_sim %>% 
    filter(Day == max(Day))
probs <- c(.005, .025, .25, .5, .75, .975, .995)
dist_end_stock_prices <- quantile(end_stock_prices$Stock.Price, probs = probs)
dist_end_stock_prices %>% round(2)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##   0.5%   2.5%    25%    50%    75%  97.5%  99.5% 
##  64.34  69.37 104.48 129.99 164.39 227.69 318.03
{% endhighlight %}

The 95% confidence interval is between $69.37 and $227.69, with a median ("most likely") estimated price of $129.99. 

Is this realistic? It looks close considering the simulated growth rate is very close to the historical [compound annual growth rate (CAGR)](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp):


{% highlight r %}
# Inputs
N_hist          <- nrow(MA) / 252
p_start_hist    <- MA$MA.Adjusted[[1]]
p_end_hist      <- MA$MA.Adjusted[[nrow(MA)]]
N_sim           <- N / 252
p_start_sim     <- p_end_hist
p_end_sim       <- dist_end_stock_prices[[4]]
# CAGR calculations

## Understanding Drivers of the Simulation <a class="anchor" id="sim-drivers"></a>

Most importantly, the simulation gives us a baseline to compare stocks using the key drivers. The drivers of the simulation are the __mean and the standard deviation of the log returns__: The mean characterizes the average growth or return while the standard deviation characterizes the volatility or risk.

We now know how to analyze an individual stock using log returns, but wouldn't it be better if we could apply this analysis to many stocks so we can review and screen them based on risk versus reward? Uh... yes! This is easy to do. Let's get going!


# Stock Analysis: Expanded to All S&amp;P500 Stocks <a class="anchor" id="sa-sp500"></a>

We'll expand to a __full blown S&amp;P500 Analysis__ following the modeling process workflow from [R For Data Science, Chapter 25: Many Models](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html). Once we have a modeling process down for an individual stock, we can map it to many stocks using a modeling workflow. Our workflow involves four steps:

1. [Get the list of S&amp;P500 stocks.](#web-scraping)
2. [Create functions that retrieve needed data from a single stock. We'll need to get stock prices, and compute log-returns.](#create-functions)
3. [Utilize `purrr` to `map()` the functions across all stocks.](#map-functions)
4. [Visualize the results.](#visualize-results)


## Web Scraping: Get the List of S&amp;P500 Stocks <a class="anchor" id="web-scraping"></a>

We'll use the `rvest` package to collect S&amp;P500 stocks from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies). We use `read_html()` to collect the HTML from Wikipedia. Then, we parse the HTML to a data frame using `html_node()` and `html_table()`. At the end, I return the data as a `tibble`, and cleanup the column names.


{% highlight r %}
library(rvest)
# Web-scrape SP500 stock list
sp_500 <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies") %>%
    html_node("table.wikitable") %>%
    html_table() %>%
    select(`Ticker symbol`, Security, `GICS Sector`, `GICS Sub Industry`) %>%
    as_tibble()
# Format names
names(sp_500) <- sp_500 %>% 
    names() %>% 
    str_to_lower() %>% 
    make.names()
# Show results
sp_500 
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 505 × 4
##    ticker.symbol            security            gics.sector
##            <chr>               <chr>                  <chr>
## 1            MMM          3M Company            Industrials
## 2            ABT Abbott Laboratories            Health Care
## 3           ABBV              AbbVie            Health Care
## 4            ACN       Accenture plc Information Technology
## 5           ATVI Activision Blizzard Information Technology
## 6            AYI   Acuity Brands Inc            Industrials
## 7           ADBE   Adobe Systems Inc Information Technology
## 8            AAP  Advance Auto Parts Consumer Discretionary
## 9            AES            AES Corp              Utilities
## 10           AET           Aetna Inc            Health Care
## # ... with 495 more rows, and 1 more variables:
## #   gics.sub.industry <chr>
{% endhighlight %}


The `sp_500` data frame has four columns:

* `ticker.symbol`: The stock ticker
* `security`: The company name
* `gics.sector`: The primary sector according to the [GICS](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gics.asp)
* `gics.sub.industry`: The industry sub sector according to the [GICS](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gics.asp)

It's a good idea to inspect the categorical data before we start the analysis. The `lapply()` function below loops through each column of the data set counting the length of the unique items. The result is a count of distinct values for each column. 


{% highlight r %}
sp_500 %>% 
    lapply(function(x) x %>% unique() %>% length()) %>%
    unlist() # show in condensed format

__We have a minor problem:__

Notice that we have 505 ticker symbols but only 504 securities. There must be a duplicate entry in securities. Let's inspect any securities that are duplicated. We'll use the `dplyr` functions `group_by()`, `summarize()`, and `filter()` to find any `security` that appears more than once. 


{% highlight r %}
sp_500 %>%
    group_by(security) %>%
    summarize(count = n()) %>%
    filter(count > 1)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##       security count
##          <chr> <int>
## 1 Under Armour     2
{% endhighlight %}

The culprit is Under Armour. Let's check out why. 


{% highlight r %}
sp_500 %>% 
    filter(security == "Under Armour")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 2 × 4
##   ticker.symbol     security            gics.sector
##           <chr>        <chr>                  <chr>
## 1            UA Under Armour Consumer Discretionary
## 2          UA.C Under Armour Consumer Discretionary
## # ... with 1 more variables: gics.sub.industry <chr>
{% endhighlight %}

Under Armour has two ticker symbols: UA and UA.C. We'll remove the UA.C from the data set.


{% highlight r %}
sp_500 <- sp_500 %>% 
    filter(ticker.symbol != "UA.C")
{% endhighlight %}

__Back to inspecting the S&amp;P500 data:__

We know from the `lapply()` function that there are 504 securities that are in 126 sub industries and in 10 sectors. However, we might want to understand the distribution of securities by sector. I again use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to get counts. In the visualization, I use `forcats::fct_reorder()` to organize the `gics.sector` by greatest frequency (`count`). The `forcats` package makes organizing `factor` categories a breeze in R, which previously was a huge pain! Check out [R for Data Science, Chapter 15: Factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) for help working with factors.


{% highlight r %}
sp_500 %>%
    # Summarise data by frequency
    group_by(gics.sector) %>%
    summarise(count = n()) %>%
    # Visualize 
    ggplot(aes(x = gics.sector %>% fct_reorder(count),
               y = count
               )) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_text(aes(label = count), size = 3, nudge_y = 4, nudge_x = .1) + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,100)) +
    ggtitle(label = "Sector Frequency Among SP500 Stocks") +
    xlab(label = "GICS Sector") +

    coord_flip() 
{% endhighlight %}

Separating the distribution of securities into industry sectors shows us our options if we were to select stocks using a __diversification strategy__. While diversification and portfolio optimization is outside the scope of this tutorial, it's worth mentioning that a risk mitigation technique is to select a basket (or portfolio) of stocks that have __low return correlation__. Typically, selecting from different industries and sectors helps to reduce this correlation and diversify the portfolio. While I don't go into portfolio optimization, as a bonus I'll show how it's possible to visualize the correlations of the best performing stocks.

## Creating Functions to Map <a class="anchor" id="create-functions"></a>

<p class="text-info">
<strong>Technical Details Ahead:</strong> 
We are going to dive into some structural aspects of <code>xts</code> and <code>tibble</code> objects. Feel free to skip the details and copy the functions in this section. You will still be able to follow along.  
</p>

We have a tidy data frame (`tibble`) of S&amp;P500 securities stored in the variable `sp_500`. We want to perform some functions on the data frame such as:

1. Getting the stock prices for each security using `getSymbols()`.
2. Getting the log returns of the stock prices `periodReturn()`.

We need to come through an issue between `xts` and `tibble` objects before we jump into mapping the functions. We are going to create nested data frames, which basically means that the data is stored as a list in the cells of `sp_500` (Don't worry if this doesn't make sense yet). A structural issue occurs with nesting `xts` objects within `tibble` data frames. The `xts` objects won't unnest. To get around this structural issue, we need to convert these objects to `tibble` format.

### Get Stock Prices Function 

First, let's create a function to return the stock prices. `get_stock_prices()` is a wrapper for `quantmod::getSymbols()` that takes a ticker, a return format, and any other `getSymbols()` arguments and returns the prices in either `xts` or `tibble` format. In this post, we'll use the `tibble` format for unnesting. We set `auto.assign = FALSE` to return the object to the variable rather than automatically creating the variable in the Global Environment. 


{% highlight r %}
get_stock_prices <- function(ticker, return_format = "tibble", ...) {
    # Get stock prices
    stock_prices_xts <- getSymbols(Symbols = ticker, auto.assign = FALSE, ...)
    # Rename
    names(stock_prices_xts) <- c("Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume", "Adjusted")
    # Return in xts format if tibble is not specified
    if (return_format == "tibble") {
        stock_prices <- stock_prices_xts %>%
            as_tibble() %>%
            rownames_to_column(var = "Date") %>%
            mutate(Date = ymd(Date))
    } else {
        stock_prices <- stock_prices_xts
    }
    stock_prices
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see what happens when we try `get_stock_prices()` on MasterCard using ticker, "MA".


{% highlight r %}
"MA" %>%
    get_stock_prices(return_format = 'tibble')
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 2,475 × 7

## # ... with 2,465 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

A few key actions that happened:

1. Instead of creating an object `MA` in the Global Environment, an object was created as a local variable that we immediately output to the screen. This is important when using `map()`, which needs to return a local object rather than auto assign an object in the Global Environment.

2. The object returned has a consistent column name structure. This is needed if we plan to `unnest()` the object. More on this later.

3. We specified `return_format = "tibble"`, which can be nested (`tidyr::nest()`) and unnested (`tidyr::unnest()`).

### Get Log Returns Function

Next, we need a function to get log returns. `get_log_returns()` is a wrapper for `quantmod::periodReturns()` that takes a stock prices in `xts` or `tibble` format, a return format, and any other `periodReturns()` arguments and returns the log returns in either `xts` or `tibble` format.


{% highlight r %}
get_log_returns <- function(x, return_format = "tibble", period = 'daily', ...) {
    # Convert tibble to xts
    if (!is.xts(x)) {
        x <- xts(x[,-1], order.by = x$Date)
    }
    # Get log returns
    log_returns_xts <- periodReturn(x = x$Adjusted, type = 'log', period = period, ...)
    # Rename
    names(log_returns_xts) <- "Log.Returns"
    # Return in xts format if tibble is not specified
    if (return_format == "tibble") {
        log_returns <- log_returns_xts %>%
            as_tibble() %>%
            rownames_to_column(var = "Date") %>%
            mutate(Date = ymd(Date))
    } else {
        log_returns <- log_returns_xts
    }
    log_returns
}
{% endhighlight %}

We'll test the function to see what it returns:


{% highlight r %}
"MA" %>% 
    get_stock_prices(return_format = "tibble") %>% 
    get_log_returns(return_format = "tibble") 
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

## # ... with 2,465 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

Same as before, the return format is a `tibble`, which is exactly what we need for mapping into nested data frames next.

## Mapping the Functions <a class="anchor" id="map-functions"></a>

Now the fun part! We are going to use `purrr::map()` to build a nested data frame. If you're not familiar with nested data frames, check out `tidyr::nest()` and [R For Data Science, Chapter 25: Many Models](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html). Data frames can store lists in columns, which means we can store data frames in the cells of data frames (aka nesting). The `map()` function allows us to map functions to the nested list-columns. The result is the ability to extend complex calculations to loop through entire data frames. 

It's OK if the script below doesn't make sense. We'll get a feel for what happened by exploring the results.

<p class="text-warning">

                                                            return_format = "tibble",

                           ),
        log.returns  = map(stock.prices, 
                              function(.x) get_log_returns(.x, return_format = "tibble")),
        mean.log.returns = map_dbl(log.returns, ~ mean(.$Log.Returns)),
        sd.log.returns   = map_dbl(log.returns, ~ sd(.$Log.Returns)),
        n.trade.days = map_dbl(stock.prices, nrow)

It's the stock prices for the first stock, [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM?p=MMM): all 2470 observations. 

__Key point on nested tibbles: The sub-data (e.g. stock prices, log returns) are all stored as data frames within the upper-level data frame (e.g. `sp_500`)! This means we can sort, filter, and perform calculations on all the sub-data at once with the nested tibbles, and the sub-data for each observation goes along for the ride.__ 

The final output included `mean.log.returns`, `sd.log.returns`, and `n.trade.days`, which were mapped using the `map_dbl()` function. The `map()` function always returns a `list`, but sometimes we want a value. For scalars we can return the value using `map_dbl()`, `map_chr()`, ..., depending on the return type. Let's check out the final output.

__To recap:__

Essentially, we collected the stock prices for every S&amp;P500 stock ticker using `get_stock_prices()`, then passed each set of stock prices to `get_log_returns()`, then sent the log returns for each stock to the `mean()` and `sd()` functions to return the values we want to compare on. Pretty cool. ;) 

You may also see that I added a variable, `n.trade.days`, for the number of trade days (observations) for the stock. We want stocks with a large number of observations because this gives us more samples (and a longer time span) to trend the stock, thus increasing our confidence in the statistics. This will come in handy when we perform our visualization next.


## Visualizing the Results with Plotly <a class="anchor" id="visualize-results"></a>

Back to the main purpose: __we want to compare all of the S&amp;P500 stocks based on risk versus reward__. As stated before, we consider: 

* Rewarding stocks have a higher mean of the log returns (measure of growth).
* Riskier stocks have a higher standard deviation of the log returns (measure of volatility). 

What we need is a way to visualize a scatter plot of all of the stocks, showing the stock name and it's related information in one concise plot. The `plotly` library is perfect for this task. Using hover fields and color/size characteristics we can quickly get the essence of the data to screen the stocks.

The script below uses `plot_ly()` to create a scatter plot showing the standard deviation of log-returns (x-axis), the mean log-returns (y-axis), and the number of trade days collected (size and color aesthetics). Using the `text` argument, we can add information to the plot upon hover. __Data exploration can be performed using the hover, zoom, and pan fetures. Try it out and develop your intuition about which stocks are the best investments.__

From the plot we can see that a number of stocks have a unique combination of high mean and low standard deviation log returns. We can isolate them:


{% highlight r %}
sp_500 %>%
    filter(mean.log.returns >= 0.001,
           sd.log.returns < 0.0315) %>%

Upon inspection [PCLN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PCLN?p=PCLN) sports a unique combination of low volatility, high average returns, and a lot of samples. Here's the `quantmod` chart:

### Questions About the Analysis

1. What can you say about the relationship between the standard deviation and mean of the log returns? Does there appear to be one? As volatility (standard deviation of returns) increases, what tends to happen to growth (mean increase of returns)?

2. The stock with the ninth highest mean is [HPE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HPE/?p=HPE). Would you use it in as an investment? Why or why not?

3. How can the investment analysis be improved to form a well-rounded strategy? (Hints: What about qualitative analysis in addition to quantitative analysis? What about dividends? What about back testing for performance?)


# Bonus: Computing Correlations <a class="anchor" id="compute-corr"></a>

Selecting a portfolio of stocks can be challenging because on the one hand you want to select those with the best performance, but on the other hand you want to diversify your investment so you don't have all your eggs in one basket. The quantitative analysis done previously presented a method to screen stocks with high potential. To balance this, a correlation assessment can be performed to visualize which high potential stocks are least correlated.

Let's first cut the list down to the top 30 stocks with more than four years of samples (approx 1000 trading days). We'll add a `rank` column using the `min_rank()` function on `mean.log.returns`, and filter the data on the top 30 ranked means. 


{% highlight r %}
limit <- 30
sp_500_hp <- sp_500 %>%
    filter(n.trade.days > 1000) %>%
    filter(sd.log.returns < 0.0315) %>%
    mutate(rank = mean.log.returns %>% desc() %>% min_rank()) %>%
    filter(rank <= limit) %>%
    arrange(rank) %>%
    select(ticker.symbol, rank, mean.log.returns, sd.log.returns, log.returns)
sp_500_hp  
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

## # ... with 20 more rows, and 1 more variables: log.returns <list>
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we need to `unnest()` the tibble: `unnest()` effectively ungroups the nested tibbles within the top level of the tibble (You'll see what I mean below). We only need to keep the `ticker.symbol` and the unnested `log.returns` data. 


{% highlight r %}
sp_500_hp_unnest <- sp_500_hp %>%
    select(ticker.symbol, log.returns) %>%
    unnest()
sp_500_hp_unnest
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

## 10          PCLN 2007-01-17 -0.011740934
## # ... with 64,259 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

The unnested tibble now contains the daily log returns for the 30 stocks. Notice that there are now 64,269 rows.

The last data manipulation task is to get the unnested tibble into the format for correlation analysis. We need to `tidyr::spread()` the `ticker.symbols` to get them into the columns. Because not all the stocks have data for the full range of dates, we need to use `na.omit()` to remove rows with `NA` values.


{% highlight r %}
sp_500_hp_spread <- sp_500_hp_unnest %>%
    spread(key = ticker.symbol, value = Log.Returns) %>%
    na.omit()
sp_500_hp_spread

Finally, we are ready to get and visualize correlations. We'll use the `corrplot` package for visualizing the correlations. We remove the `Date` column so only values remain. Then, we send to the `cor()` function, which calculates the correlations.  


{% highlight r %}
sp_500_hp_cor <- sp_500_hp_spread %>%
    select(-Date) %>%
    cor() 
sp_500_hp_cor[1:6, 1:6] # show first 6 columns and rows

{% endhighlight %}

We send the correlations to `corrplot()` to visualize the correlations. I ordered using `hclust`, which groups the stocks by similarity. The `addrect` argument adds boxes around the highly correlated groups, and by inspecting the circle colors I settled on 11 boxes.


{% highlight r %}
library(corrplot)
sp_500_hp_cor %>%
    corrplot(order   = "hclust", 
             addrect = 11)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk corplot](/figure/source/2016-10-23-SP500_Analysis/corplot-1.png)


The key is to choose stocks that have low correlation. For example, you might select the combination of [AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?p=AMZN) and [FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB) because their returns have low correlations. However, you might select only one from [APPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=APPL),  [AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO?p=AVGO) and [SWKS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SWKS?p=SWKS) because the stocks are highly correlated. The high correlations make sense because _Avago_ (_Broadcom_) and _Skyworks_ are semiconductor manufacturers that supply _Apple_ iPhones. 


# Download the .R File <a class="anchor" id="download"></a>

The [.R file](https://github.com/mdancho84/quantitative_stock_analysis_tutorial) file is available on _GitHub_. The `.R` file has everything needed to generate the `plotly` and `corrplot` visualizations. Depending on your PC processing power, it should take just a minute or two to run.  


# Conclusions <a class="anchor" id="conclusions"></a>

The quantitative analysis is a powerful tool. Thanks to `purrr` and other `tidyverse` packages the analysis can easily be extended to many stocks to compare and screen potential investments. However, before we jump into making investment decisions, we need to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the analysis: 

* Computing quantitative statistics (mean and standard deviation) of stock returns should be a go-to resource for evaluating stocks. It provides useful performance metrics that quantitatively characterize risk and reward.

* Correlation analysis identifies the extent to which assets are correlated. When building a portfolio, the general rule is to select assets with a balance of high performance (i.e. quantitative statistics) and low correlation.

* The analysis discussed herein is purely quantitative, taking into account the historical performance only. __Selecting investments on statistics alone is never a good idea.__ Evaluation of the fundamentals (e.g. asset valuation, EPS growth, future industry prospects, level of competition, industry diversification, etc) should be investigated as a compliment to the quantitative analysis to form a well-rounded investment strategy. 
 

# Recap <a class="anchor" id="recap"></a>

We covered a lot of ground in this post: starting from a basic quantitative stock analysis, and ending on __a full fleged S&amp;P500 stock screening workflow__! If you've read and understood the full post, congratulations! This post required an understanding of quantitative stock analysis, R programming, and many powerful R packages including:

* `quantmod`: Retrieving stock prices (`getSymbols()`) and returns (`periodReturns()`), and visualizing stock charts (`chartSeries()`)
* `xts` (extensible timeseries) objects: A key structure in R for timeseries data
* `rvest`: Web scraping tools in R
* `tidyverse`: A compilation of the following packages:
  * `tibble`: The data frame format for working with tidy data
  * `purrr`: For mapping functions (`map()`) to tibbles (tidy data frames), and scaling the modeling workflow to many models
  * `tidyr`: For manipulating tibble form using `spread()`, `gather()`, `nest()` and `unnest()`
  * `dplyr`: For manipulating tibble variables (columns) using `mutate()`, `group_by()` + `summarize()`, `select()`, and `filter()`
  * `ggplot2`: For static visualizations using the grammar of graphics
* `plotly`: For interactive visualizations
* `corrplot`: For visualizing correlation plots

Probably the most important concept is that you now should have a basic understanding of a __modeling workflow__: Developing the analysis for a single observation (e.g. a stock ticker), and then expanding it to many observations (e.g. the entire S&amp;P500 list of stock tickers). 

Again, great job for making it this far! Happy investing. :)
