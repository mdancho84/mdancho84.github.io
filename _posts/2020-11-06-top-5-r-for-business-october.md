This is a true story based on [how I created my data science company from scratch](https://www.business-science.io//business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html). Itâ€™s a detailed documentation of my personal journey along with the company I founded, Business Science, and the data science educational university I started,<a href="https://university.business-science.io/">  Business Science University </a>.

Have you considered starting a data science company? The journey will try your patience. You will question yourself. You will be spread thin. You will need to learn from failure. You will have to pick yourself up when you get knocked down. You will need to depend on friends, and you must be willing to ask for help.
