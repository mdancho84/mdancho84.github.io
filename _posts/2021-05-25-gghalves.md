# What is gghalves?

`gghalves` is a new R package that makes it easy to compose your own half-plots using `ggplot2`.

# What are Half Plots? <br><small>Combining two plots side-by-side.</small>

Half/Half Plots are a way to showcase two plots side-by-side. Here's a common example:

1. Showing a **Boxplot** to identify outliers and quantiles
2. Showing a **Dotplot** to identify distribution

We can easily do this with a half-plot thanks to `gghalves`.

<br>

# Before we get started, get the R Cheat Sheet

`gghalves` is great for making customized `ggplot2` plots. But, you'll still need to learn how to wrangle data with `dplyr` and visualize data with `ggplot2`. For those topics, I'll use the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) to refer to `dplyr` and `ggplot2` code in my workflow.

### Quick Example:

[Download the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) **Then Click the "CS" next to "ggplot2"** opens the Data Visualization with GGplot2 Cheat Sheet.

<a href="https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html"> <img src="/assets/2021-05-11-patchwork/workflow.jpg" style='max-width:100%;'>

Now you're ready to quickly reference `ggplot2` functions.

Onto the tutorial.

# How gghalves works

The `gghalves` package extends `ggplot2` by adding several new "geoms" (ggplot geometries) that allow us to add half plots. In this tutorial, we'll cover:

* `geom_half_boxplot()`: For creating half-boxplots
* `geom_half_dotplot()`: For creating half-dotplots

<div  class="well">
<h5>Pro Tip:</h5>
<p>Simply type "geom_half" in your R console and hit Tab to show all of the half plotting geoms available. </p>
</div>

## Load the Libraries and Data

First, run this code to:

1. **Load Libraries:** Load `gghalves`, `tidyverse` and `tidyquant`.
2. **Import Data:** We're using the `mpg` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`.

## Make the Half-Boxplot / Half-Dotplot

Next, we can combine a half-boxplot and half-dotplot. This has the advantage of showing:

* **Quantiles and Outliers (Boxplot)**
* **Distribution (Dotplot)**

### Business Goal

Suppose we have a question:

> What effect does **Engine Size (number of Cylinders)** have on **Vehicle Highway Fuel Economy (Highway MPG)**?

We can visualize this with `gghalves` by making half-plots of Cylinder vs Highway.

### Half-Plot Visualization Code

Using the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html), we can make a `ggplot` from the ggplot2 data visualization cheat sheet. We'll add `geom_half_boxplot()` and `geom_half_dotplot()` to make the half-plots of Cylinder vs Highway.

### Half-Plot Visualization

Here is the visualization. We can explore to find an interesting relationship between Engine Size and Fuel Economy.

### Insights: <span style='color:#18bc9c'>Bimodal Distribution</span> of 6-Cylinder Engine Class

Generally speaking, fuel economy goes down as engine size increases. But, the 6-Cylinder engine has something unique going on that has been uncovered by the `gghalves::geom_half_dotplot()`.

The 6-Cylinder Engine class of car has a **bimodal distribution**, which is when there are two peaks. This generally indicates that there are two different populations within the group. We need to investigate with `ggplot2`.

### Exploring the Bimodal Relationship

We can explore the 6 Cylinder Vehicle Class a bit further to identify the cause of the Bimodal Distribution. It looks like:

* **SUV and Pickup classes** have much lower fuel economy
* **Compact, Midsize, Minivan, and Subcompact** have much higher fuel economy

# Why Learning ggplot2 is essential

I wouldn't be nearly as effective as a data scientist without knowing `ggplot2`. In fact, data visualization has been one of two skills that have been critical to my career (with the other one being data transformation).

### Case Study: This tutorial showcases exactly why visualization is important

<img src="/assets/2021-05-25-gghalves/explore-bimodal-annotated.jpg" style='max-width:100%;margin-bottom:5px;'>
<p class='text-center date'>
<a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

Let's just take this tutorial as a case study. Without being able to visualize with `ggplot2`:

* We wouldn't be able to visually identify the Bimodal Distribution. We needed to see that to know to explore the 6-Cylinder Engine Class.
* We wouldn't have been able to explore the 6-Cylinder Engine Class. This showed us the importance of the Vehicle Class (e.g. SUV, Pickups being lower and Compact, Subcompact being higher in fuel economy).

## Career Tip: <span style='color:#18bc9c;'>Learn ggplot2</span>

If I had one piece of advice, it would be to start learning `ggplot2`. Let me explain.

<img src="/assets/2021-05-25-gghalves/career-tip.jpg" style='max-width:80%'>

Learning `ggplot2` helped me to:

* **Explain complex topics** to non-technical people
* **Develop good reports** that showcased important points visually
* **Make persuasive arguments** that got the attention of Senior Management and even my CEO

So, yes, learning `ggplot2` was absolutely essential to my career. I received many promotions and got the attention of my CEO using `ggplot2` effectively.
