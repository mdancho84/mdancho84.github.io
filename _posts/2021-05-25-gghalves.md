# What are Half Plots? <br><small>Combining two plots side-by-side.</small>

<figure class="text-center">

Half/Half Plots are a way to showcase two plots side-by-side. Here's a common example:

1. Showing a __Boxplot__ to identify outliers and quantiles

2. Showing a __Dotplot__ to identify distribution

We can easily do this with a half-plot thanks to `gghalves`.

# Before we get started, get the R Cheat Sheet

`gghalves` is great for making customized `ggplot2` plots. But, you'll still need to learn how to wrangle data with `dplyr` and visualize data with `ggplot2`. For those topics, I'll use the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) to refer to `dplyr` and `ggplot2` code in my workflow.

### Quick Example:

[Download the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) __Then Click the "CS" next to "ggplot2"__ opens the Data Visualization with GGplot2 Cheat Sheet.

<a href="https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html"> <img src="/assets/2021-05-11-patchwork/workflow.jpg" style='max-width:100%;'>

Now you're ready to quickly reference `ggplot2` functions.

Onto the tutorial.

# How gghalves works


The `gghalves` package extends `ggplot2` by adding several new "geoms" (ggplot geometries) that allow us to add half plots. In this tutorial, we'll cover:

- `geom_half_boxplot()`: For creating half-boxplots
- `geom_half_dotplot()`: For creating half-dotplots

<div  class="well">
<h5>Pro Tip:</h5>
<p>Simply type "geom_half" in your R console and hit Tab to show all of the half plotting geoms available. </p>
</div>

## Load the Libraries and Data
First, run this code to:

1. __Load Libraries:__ Load `gghalves`, `tidyverse` and `tidyquant`. 
2. __Import Data:__ We're using the `mpg` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`.

## Make the Half-Boxplot / Half-Dotplot

Next, we can combine a half-boxplot and half-dotplot. This has the advantage of showing:

- __Quantiles and Outliers (Boxplot)__
- __Distribution (Dotplot)__

### Business Goal

Suppose we have a question:

> What effect does __Engine Size (number of Cylinders)__ have on __Vehicle Highway Fuel Economy (Highway MPG)__?

We can visualize this with `gghalves` by making half-plots of Cylinder vs Highway. 

### Half-Plot Visualization Code

Here is the `ggplot` + `gghalves` code to make the half-plots of Cylinder vs Highway.

### Half-Plot Visualization

Here is the visualization. We can explore to find an interesting relationship between Engine Size and Fuel Economy.

### Insights: <span style='color:#18bc9c'>Bimodal Distribution</span> of 6-Cylinder Engine Class

Generally speaking, fuel economy goes down as engine size increases. But, the 6-Cylinder engine has something unique going on that has been uncovered by the `gghalves::geom_half_dotplot()`.

The 6-Cylinder Engine class of car has a __bimodal distribution__, which is when there are two peaks. This generally indicates that there are two different populations within the group. We need to investigate with `ggplot2`.

</p>

### Exploring the Bimodal Relationship

We can explore the 6 Cylinder Vehicle Class a bit further to identify the cause of the Bimodal Distribution. It looks like:

- __SUV and Pickup classes__ have much lower fuel economy 
- __Compact, Midsize, Minivan, and Subcompact__ have much higher fuel economy

# Why Learning ggplot2 is essential

I wouldn't be nearly as effective as a data scientist without knowing `ggplot2`. In fact, data visualization has been one of two skills that have been critical to my career (with the other one being data transformation).

### Case Study: This tutorial showcases exactly why visualization is important

<img src="/assets/2021-05-25-gghalves/explore-bimodal-annotated.jpg" style='max-width:100%;margin-bottom:5px;'>
<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

Let's just take this tutorial as a case study. Without being able to visualize with `ggplot2`: 

- We wouldn't be able to visually identify the Bimodal Distribution. We needed to see that to know to explore the 6-Cylinder Engine Class. 

- We wouldn't have been able to explore the 6-Cylinder Engine Class. This showed us the importance of the Vehicle Class (e.g. SUV, Pickups being lower and Compact, Subcompact being higher in fuel economy).


## Career Tip: <span style='color:#18bc9c;'>Learn ggplot2</span>

If I had one piece of advice, it would be to start learning `ggplot2`. Let me explain.

<img src="/assets/2021-05-25-gghalves/career-tip.jpg" style='max-width:80%'>

Learning `ggplot2` helped me to:

- __Explain complex topics__ to non-technical people
- __Develop good reports__ that showcased important points visually
- __Make persuasive arguments__ that got the attention of Senior Management and even my CEO

So, yes, learning `ggplot2` was absolutely essential to my career. I received many promotions and got the attention of my CEO using `ggplot2` effectively.

If you'd like to learn `ggplot2` and data science for business, then read on. ðŸ‘‡



# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn data science. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.  I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

__If you feel like this, you're not alone.__

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. __Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught smartly__

2. __Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.__

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will __get you past your struggles__ and improve your career in the process. 

It's called the [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 5+ projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment. 

The result is that __you break through previous struggles__, learning from my experience & our community of 2000+ data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
