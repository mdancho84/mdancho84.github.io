We're happy to announce the third release of the `tibbletime` package. This is a __huge update__, mainly due to a complete rewrite of the package. It contains a ton of __new functionality__ and a number of breaking changes that existing users need to be aware of. All of the changes have been well documented in the [NEWS](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/news/index.html) file, but it's worthwhile to touch on a few of them here and discuss the __future of the package__. We're super excited so let's check out the vision for `tibbletime` and its new functionality!

## About Tibbletime

For those new to to package, `tibbletime` is a new package that enables the creation of time aware tibbles. It's sole purpose is to make working with time series in the tidyverse much easier! The [documentation](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/) really explains everything, and here are a few important vignettes that can help get you up to speed on all of the functionality:

- [Time-Based Filtering](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/articles/TT-01-time-based-filtering.html)
- [Changing Periodicity](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/articles/TT-02-changing-time-periods.html)
- [Rolling Calculations In tibbletime](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/articles/TT-03-rollify-for-rolling-analysis.html)
- [Using tibbletime With dplyr](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/articles/TT-04-use-with-dplyr.html) __BRAND NEW!!__

![tibbletime overview](/assets/tibbletime-0-1-0-overview.png)

## Package roadmap

The grand view is to have `tibbletime` function as a base package that others can build off of, utilizing the infrastructure that "knows" about the index column and provides support for time series transformations on tibbles. This can include extensions to finance, but also has room to grow into other areas such as economic forecasting, longitudinal studies, and other general time series analyses. We've already begun work on one such package, but that will be a post for another time ;).

At this point, the first bit of core functionality for `tibbletime` is complete. A few other functions will likely be added, but we will definitely support backwards compatability from here on out.

## New time series capabilities

The `tibbletime` package was completely re-invisioned, making it much more flexible and general. Here are a few of the important new tools in `tibbletime`'s toolkit:

- A new index partitioning function (`collapse_index()`) that opens up powerful time based analysis with _any_ `dplyr` function, rather than a specific (and limited) set of `time_summarise()`, `time_mutate()`, etc, functions.

- Full support for `Date` and `POSIXct` classes as indices, and experimental support for `yearmon`, `yearqtr`, and `hms` which should get more stable over time.

- A consistent API along with more informative argument names that attempt to give it that intuitive look and feel of a `tidyverse` package.

The one downside is that we had to make a few __breaking changes__, but with this post you'll be able to easily get your code up to speed with the new functionality. What follows are a few of the most important changes for those that already used `tibbletime` and are interested in seeing what has changed. 


### Libraries

Load the following libraries to follow along.


{% highlight r %}
library(tibbletime)
library(dplyr)
{% endhighlight %}

### time_collapse() -> collapse_index()

Rather than having a function like `time_collapse()` that worked on an entire `tbl_time` object, it has been replaced with `partition_index()` and `collapse_index()` that solely manipulate the index (date) vector. This allows them to be used inside of a call to `mutate()` and gives the user more control over the outcome (for example, whether they want to assign it to a new column or overwrite the original index column).
  

{% highlight r %}
data(FB)

FB_time <- FB %>%
  as_tbl_time(date)

FB_time
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

## # ... with 998 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

The index has been collapsed. We can now do easy `dplyr` operations like summarizes.


{% highlight r %}
FB_collapsed <- FB_time %>%
  mutate(date = collapse_index(date, "5 day"))

FB_collapsed
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

{% endhighlight %}

  
An added bonus of this is that it promotes an integration with `dplyr` that renders the previous need for `time_summarise()` and other `time_*()` functions obsolete. Rather, you now group on the collapsed date column and can then use _any_ dplyr function that your heart desires. For example, here is a powerful example of easily creating 6 month summaries for every column of Facebook using `summarise_if()`.


{% highlight r %}
FB_time %>%
  mutate(date = collapse_index(date, "6 month")) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, funs(avg = mean, std_dev = sd))
{% endhighlight %}

{% endhighlight %}

This incremental approach utilizing `dplyr` groups should feel natural to any `tidyverse` user. Because of this improved workflow, `time_summarise()` and friends have been removed. 

### time_filter() -> filter_time()

A simple change, but with the removal of other `time_*()` functions it makes more sense to rename `time_filter()` as `filter_time()`.

### Formula style arguments

Those familiar with `tibbletime` may be used to the formula style shorthand used in specifying both the `period` and `time_formula` arguments found throughout the package. The `period` argument now only accepts characters as there was little added benefit from using formulas. The `time_formula` argument found in `filter_time()` and `create_series()` still use the `from ~ to` style syntax, but each side must be a character rather than a bare specification.

#### Period Specification

Previous way (error):


{% highlight r %}
as_period(FB_time, period = 2~y)
{% endhighlight %}

New way (quoted, no error):


{% highlight r %}
as_period(FB_time, period = "2 y")
{% endhighlight %}

#### Time Formula Specification

Previous way (error):


{% highlight r %}
filter_time(FB_time, 2013-03 ~ 2014-05)
{% endhighlight %}

This may seem like a step backwards, but it is more robust to program with and allows the user to pass in actual variables to the time formula (something that was requested a few times but was difficult to do). In this example you can use characters or real Date objects, both of which are then unquoted appropriately using `rlang`.


{% highlight r %}
my_date_char <- "2013-03-01"
my_date <- as.Date(my_date_char)
{% endhighlight %}

Programming with character date. 


{% highlight r %}
filter_time(FB_time, ~my_date_char)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 1 x 8
## # Index: date
##   symbol date        open  high   low close   volume adjusted
##   <chr>  <date>     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
## 1 FB     2013-03-01  27.0  28.1  26.8  27.8 54064800     27.8
{% endhighlight %}

Programming with "date" class date. 


{% highlight r %}
filter_time(FB_time, ~my_date)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 1 x 8
## # Index: date
##   symbol date        open  high   low close   volume adjusted
##   <chr>  <date>     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>

{% endhighlight %}


While we are on the topic of `filter_time()`, check out the new keywords `"start"` and `"end"` that you can use in your formula specification. 

Using keyword `"start"`:


{% highlight r %}
filter_time(FB_time, "start" ~ "2013-01-05")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 3 x 8
## # Index: date

{% endhighlight %}

Using keyword `"end"`:


{% highlight r %}
filter_time(FB_time, "2016-12-25" ~ "end")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 4 x 8
## # Index: date
