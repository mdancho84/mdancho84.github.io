This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

<br/>

Making multiple ARIMA Time Series models in R used to be difficult. But, with the `purrr` `nest()` function and `modeltime`, forecasting has never been easier. Learn how to make many ARIMA models in this tutorial. Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡

# What is Nest?

**Nesting is a data frame reshaping tool that produces a "nested" structure.**

The nested structure is super powerful for modeling groups of data. We'll see how.
Let's check `nest()` out. With 3 lines of code, we **turn an ordinary data frame into a nested data frame**.

# ARIMA Modeling with Modeltime

So what can we do with a "Nested" Data Frame?  How about making 7 ARIMA Forecasts!

And with a little extra work (thanks to my `Modeltime` R Package), we can create this **INTERACTIVE ARIMA FORECAST**! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
