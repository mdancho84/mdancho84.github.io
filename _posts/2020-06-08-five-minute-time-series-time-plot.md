__Have 5-minutes? Then let's learn time series.__ In this short articles series, I highlight how you can get up to speed quickly on important aspects of time series analysis. Today we are focusing on the most fundamental tool, __the time plot.__ Learn how to make _interactive_ (`plotly`) and _static_ (`ggplot2`) visualizations easily with `timetk`.

# Have 5-Minutes? <br><small>Then let's learn the Time Plot</small>

This tutorial focuses on, `plot_time_series()`, a workhorse time-series plotting function that:

- Generates interactive `plotly` plots (great for exploring & shiny apps)
- Consolidates 20+ lines of `ggplot2` & `plotly` code
- Scales well to many time series
- Can be converted from interactive `plotly` to static `ggplot2` plots

Load the following libraries. For the purposes of this tutorial, I'm setting all plots to static `ggplot2` using `interactive <- FALSE`, but I encourage you to switch this to `TRUE` to see how easy it is to make interactive `plotly` plots. 


{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(timetk)

# Setup for the plotly charts (# FALSE returns ggplots)
interactive <- FALSE
{% endhighlight %}

## Plotting a Single Time Series

Let's start with a popular time series, `taylor_30_min`, which includes energy demand in megawatts at a sampling interval of 30-minutes. This is a single time series. 


{% highlight r %}
taylor_30_min
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 4,032 x 2

The `plot_time_series()` function generates an interactive `plotly` chart by default. 

- Simply provide the date variable (time-based column, `.date_var`) and the numeric variable (`.value`) that changes over time as the first 2 arguments 
- When `.interactive = TRUE`, the `.plotly_slider = TRUE` adds a date slider to the bottom of the chart. 


{% highlight r %}
taylor_30_min %>% 
  plot_time_series(date, value, 
                   .interactive = interactive, # <- Toggle this TRUE/FALSE
                   .plotly_slider = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

## Plotting Groups

Next, let's move on to a dataset with time series groups, `m4_daily`, which is a sample of 4 time series from the M4 competition that are sampled at a daily frequency.

__Visualizing grouped data__ is as simple as grouping the data set with `group_by()` prior to piping into the `plot_time_series()` function. Key points:

- Groups can be added in 2 ways: by `group_by()` or by using the `...` to add groups. 
- Groups are then converted to facets. 
- `.facet_ncol = 2` returns a 2-column faceted plot
- `.facet_scales = "free"` allows the x and y-axis of each plot to scale independently of the other plots


{% highlight r %}
m4_daily %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  plot_time_series(date, value, 
                   .facet_ncol = 2, .facet_scales = "free",
                   .interactive = interactive)
{% endhighlight %}

## Visualizing Trend with the Smoother

You may be wondering, what is that <span style="color;">___blue line___</span> that keeps showing up on all of our plots. It's called a __smoother__, and it's a really awesome way to visualize trend through the noise in a time series. 

We can adjust the smoother using:

- __Toggle on/off:__ `.smooth = TRUE/FALSE`
- __Change the flexibility of the line:__ Try `.smooth_period = "52 weeks"` (30-days of data) or `.smooth_span = 0.25` (25% of data). By default, `.smooth_span` gets priority. 

Here I'm changing the `smooth_span = 0.25` to increase the flexibility by using 25% of the data in the smoother. Not that the time series I'm using is a weekly series, `m4_weekly`.


{% highlight r %}
m4_weekly %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  plot_time_series(date, value, 
                   
                   # Smoother
                   .smooth = TRUE, 
                   .smooth_span = 0.25,           # <- Uses % of data
                   # .smooth_period = "52 weeks", # <- Uses windows of data
                   
                   .facet_ncol = 2, .facet_scales = "free",
                   .interactive = interactive)
{% endhighlight %}

## Visualizing Transformations & Sub-Groups

Let's switch to an hourly dataset with multiple groups. We can showcase:

1. __Log transformation__ to the `.value`
2. Use of `.color_var` to highlight __sub-groups.__ 

The intent is to showcase the groups in faceted plots, but to highlight weekly windows (weekly sub-groups, using `week()`) within the data while simultaneously doing a `log()` transformation to the value. This is simple to do:

1. `.value = log(value)` Applies the Log Transformation
2. The data is ungrouped, so we can add facets internally using the `...` to supply one or more facet columns.
3. `.color_var = week(date)` The date column is transformed to a `lubridate::week()` number. The color is applied to each of the week numbers. 


{% highlight r %}
m4_hourly %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  plot_time_series(date, log(value),             # Apply a Log Transformation
                   .color_var = week(date),      # Color applied to Week transformation
                   # Facet formatting
                   .facet_ncol = 2, 
                   .facet_scales = "free", 
                   .interactive = interactive)
{% endhighlight %}

## Static ggplot2 Visualizations & Customizations

All of the visualizations can be converted from interactive `plotly` (great for exploring and shiny apps) to static `ggplot2` visualizations (great for reports). 

- Toggle Interactive/Static: `.interactive = TRUE/FALSE`
- Add title, legend, x & y-axis labels: `.title`, `.color_lab`, `.x_lab` and `.y_lab`


{% highlight r %}
taylor_30_min %>%
  plot_time_series(date, value, 
                   .color_var = month(date, label = TRUE),
                   
                   .interactive = FALSE,   # <- Returns static ggplot
                   
                   # Customization
                   .title = "Taylor's MegaWatt Data",
                   .x_lab = "Date (30-min intervals)",
                   .y_lab = "Energy Demand (MW)",
                   .color_lab = "Month") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())
{% endhighlight %}
