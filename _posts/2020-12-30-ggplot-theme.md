One of the most common data science visualization is a Time Series plot. In this tutorial we'll learn how to plot time series using `ggplot`, `plotly` and `timetk`. 

Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡

## Making a Cyberpunk themed Time Series Plot

It's super-easy to make a basic time series plot with `timetk::plot_time_series()`. But did you know you can customize it!

Here's how to make a Cyberpunk 2077-themed ggplot.

### Step 1 

Make a basic plot with `timetk::plot_time_series()`. Set `.interactive = FALSE` to return a i object.

### Step 2

Create a Cyberpunk theme: Pick the colors and simply add to the `theme_cyberpunk()` ggplot2 theme function.

### Step 3

Customize! Apply `ggplot` geom and scale functions along with the previously created `theme_cyberpunk()` to make a stunning time-series visualization!
