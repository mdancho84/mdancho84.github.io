# Automate PDF Reporting with R Tutorial

Why create PDF's manually when you can automate PDFs with R?

That's exactly what I show you how to do in this tutorial. Here is the final report you will automate today.

<br>

First, make a **"Parameterized" Rmarkdown** file by modifying the YAML with a `params` section.

<br>

Next, **insert the parameters** in your Rmarkdown Template file so each of the key inputs depend on the parameters.

<br>

Finally, in a separate R Script, use `rmarkdown::render()` to **auto-magically create PDF reports** by selecting the Rmd Template file and changing the parameters using the params list.
