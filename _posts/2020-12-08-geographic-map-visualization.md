This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

<br/>

If you are explaining data related to geography or just want to visualize by latitude / longitude location, you need to know `ggplot2` & the `tidyverse` for making maps.

This tutorial will show you how to make a publication-quality visualization! Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡

# Working with Map Data

The first thing we need when creating a map is data that represents the latitude and longitude. We need to use a function called `map_data()` to collect the data in the right structure for a `ggplot2` map.

**Map Data**

Using the `map_data()` function to collect lat/long data for the entire World.

**Plotting the Map Data with ggplot2**

We can use the `geom_map()` & `coord_map()` functions to plot the world.

# Visualizing Republican Voting

So what can we do with Map Data + `ggplot2`? How about visualizing how the US voted in 1976?!

# Conclusions

We learned how to make geospatial maps with `ggplot2`. Great work! **But, there's a lot more to becoming a data scientist.**

If you'd like to become a data scientist (and have an awesome career, improve your quality of life, enjoy your job, and all the fun that comes along), then I can help with that.
