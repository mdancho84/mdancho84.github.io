This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

<br/>

If you are explaining data related to geography or just want to visualize by latitude / longitude location, you need to know `ggplot2` & the `tidyverse` for making maps. 

This tutorial will show you how to make a publication-quality visualization! Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡

# Working with Map Data

The first thing we need when creating a map is data that represents the latitude and longitude. We need to use a function called `map_data()` to collect the data in the right structure for a `ggplot2` map. 

<br>

**Map Data**

Using the `map_data()` function to collect lat/long data for the entire World.

**Plotting the Map Data with ggplot2**

We can use the `geom_map()` &amp; `coord_map()` functions to plot the world.

# Visualizing Republican Voting 

So what can we do with Map Data + `ggplot2`? How about visualizing how the US voted in 1976?!
