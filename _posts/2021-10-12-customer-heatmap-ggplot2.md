# Summary

You just created a Customer Heatmap using `ggplot2`. This is great, but there's a lot more to learning data science. 

If you'd like to learn data visualizations, data wrangling, `shiny` apps, and data science for business with R, then read on. ðŸ‘‡



# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

__It took me a long time to learn data science.__ I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.  I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way. 

__If you feel like this, you're not alone.__ Coding is tough, data science is tough, and connecting it all with the business is tough. 

# If you feel like this, you're not alone.

__The good news__ is that, after years of learning, I was able to become a highly-rated business consultant working with Fortune 500 clients and my career advanced rapidly. More than that, I was able to help others in the community by developing open source software that has been downloaded over 1,000,000 times, and I found a real passion for coding. 

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science to help people like you and me that are struggling to learn data science for business ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. __Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught smartly__

2. __Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.__

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will __get you past your struggles__ and improve your career in the process. 

It's called the [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 5+ projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment. 

The result is that __you break through previous struggles__, learning from my experience & our community of 2000+ data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
