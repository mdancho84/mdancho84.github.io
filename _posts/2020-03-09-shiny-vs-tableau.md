__`Shiny`, a web framework that is written in `R`, often gets lumped into the conversation with Tableau and PowerBI__ - two popular Business Intelligence (BI Tools) used for "Dashboarding". The critical point is that `Shiny` is much more than just a dashboarding tool: `R` and `Shiny` combine both machine learning and decision-making, packaging your data science analysis into a web application that businesses can use. Here we illustrate __3 powerful use cases for `R Shiny` Apps in business.__ [View the updated article at Business Science.](#)

# Why Shiny?

__R Shiny is often thought of as a "Dashboarding tool"__, which places it in a category occupied by products like Tableau, PowerBI, QlikView, Data Studio, and other "Business Intelligence Tools".

__Thinking of Shiny as a "Dashboarding tool" limits your perspective of what `Shiny` can do.__

Shiny is much more than just a dashboarding tool. Shiny can be used for Data Science Applications including:

1. [__✅ Meta-Applications__](#app1)

2. [__✅ Full-Stack Web Development__](#app2)

3. [__✅ Real-Time Prediction Applications__](#app3)

# R Shiny Business Capability Rating: 10 of 10

It's easy to get distracted by Tableau and PowerBI's visuals, but __when it comes to making business decisions, your organization needs to be able to <span class="text-info">take actions</span>. This is where R Shiny is lightyears ahead of the other tools - [R Shiny is a powerful ecosystem for business + data science + apps.](#shiny-ecosystem)__

<p class="text-center date"><strong>R Shiny has the highest business capability rating</strong></p>

Let's just skip straight to the benefit: <span class="text-info">__What can `Shiny` do that the others can't?__</span>

# Shiny's Capability in 3 Examples<br><small>Business Applications made possible with R Shiny</small> 

I'm going to show you Shiny's capability with 3 R Shiny Business examples. After seeing these, __the decision to learn `R Shiny` is a no-brainer.__

## Example 1: The Application Library <br><small>A Meta-Application</small> {#app1}

<p class="text-center date">
<a href="https://apps.business-science.io/" target="_blank">Business Science Application Library</a>
<br><small>A Meta-Application that houses Shiny Apps</small>
</p>

__A meta-application__ is an app that provides an interface to many other applications in a library.

__Think of a meta-app like the _Apple App Store_.__ Each application in the library serves a specific function and the Meta-App provides searching and filtering capability so users can get to the apps that they need. 

The [new Business Science App Gallery](https://apps.business-science.io/){:target="_blank"} is an example of a meta-app. The Business Science App Gallery hosts various Shiny Apps that our students build in our courses. The hosted shiny apps range from predictive dashboards to multi-user web applications with security and authentication.

__The Business Science App Gallery enables filtering using Full-Text Search and Domain/Industry Categories.__  Try searching "tidyquant" and see which apps pop up.

## Example 2: The Stock Analyzer <br><small>A Full-Stack Web Application</small> {#app2}

<a href="https://apps.business-science.io/stock_analyzer_mongo_atlas" target="_blank">

<br><small>A Full-Stack Web Application</small>
</p>

__A Full-Stack Web Application__ is an application that provides user login (authentication), security, and stores this information in a backend database, typically a NoSQL database (i.e. MongoDB).

The full-stack web app is a new concept to many data scientists, but __it's absolutely critical for organizations that need security around their business applications.__ 

__The architecture of a full-stack web application__ includes a backend database that stores user data so that multiple users can authenticate and have a customized experience.  


<img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/2020-03-09-shiny-vs-tableau/application-architecture.jpg"> 

<p class="text-center date">
Application Architecture
</p>

__Users are required to Log In (called authentication)__ with a Full-Stack Data Science App. The first screen requires authentication before the private content is rendered. Only authenticated users can pass through.

<p class="text-center date">
User Authentication (Security Layer)
</p>

Once the user logs in (authenticates), the app remembers the user's favorite stocks and app settings from the previous session. __This is called persistent data storage.__

## Example 3: Real-Time Forecasting in a Sales Dashboard <br><small>Train and Predict in Real-Time</small> {#app3}

<a href="https://business-science.shinyapps.io/sales_dashboard_demand_forecast/" target="_blank">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/2020-03-09-shiny-vs-tableau/sales-dashboard.jpg"> 
</a>

<p class="text-center date">
<a href="https://business-science.shinyapps.io/sales_dashboard_demand_forecast/" target="_blank">Sales Dashboard with Real-Time Prediction</a>
</p>

__Applications like a Sales Demand Forecast App need to make predictions (forecasts) in _real-time_.__ This is because the inputs to the forecast (which customers, products, time aggregation unit) are not known in advance. 

__Real-time prediction applications__ use ___machine learning___ to make predictions on the fly. 

Using R Shiny, we can integrate machine learning that __quickly trains a custom model and makes predictions on-demand.__
