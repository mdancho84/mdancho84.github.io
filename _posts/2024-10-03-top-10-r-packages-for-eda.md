# Importance of Exploratory Data Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a crucial step in any data science project. It helps you understand the underlying structure of your data, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and test hypotheses. EDA enables you to make informed decisions about data cleaning, feature selection, and model selection.

# Top 10 R Packages for EDA

To make your EDA process more efficient and insightful, here are the top 10 R packages you should know. [Get the R code and dataset so you can follow along here.](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website) 

## Setup the EDA Packages and Dataset in R:

First, make sure you install all of the R packages I'll be demo-ing today. Then load the data set I'll be using so you can reproduce the results. Run this code:

![Libraries and Data](/assets/086_libraries_data.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Code (In the R-Tip 086 Folder)</a></p>

## 1. skimr: Summary of the Dataset

`skimr` provides a convenient and elegant summary of your data. Run this code:

- I made a deeper writeup on `skimr`: [Get the deep-dive here.](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2021/03/09/data-quality-with-skimr.html)

## 2. psych: Descriptive Statistics

The `psych` package offers functions for psychological, psychometric, and personality research, including descriptive statistics. Run this code:

- We'll use the `describe()` function. 
- I personally like to output tables, so optionally you can use `gt::gt()` to convert to a GT HTML table. ([I made a deep dive on the GT R package here.](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2023/08/06/tables-in-r-from-excel.html))

## 3. corrplot: Correlation Matrix Visualization

`corrplot` visualizes correlation matrices using various correlation methods. There's a ton of customizations you can do. Run this code:

## 4. PerformanceAnalytics: Correlation Matrix with Scatterplots and Histograms

`PerformanceAnalytics` provides advanced charts and statistical functions for financial analysis (I actually use PerformanceAnalytics inside my `tidyquant` package for easier financial analysis). But, most people have no idea it has an amazing `chart.Correlation()` function that is fast and awesome. Run this code:

## 5. GGally: Scatterplot Matrix with Pairwise Relationships

`GGally` extends ggplot2 by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects. The `ggpairs()` function is one of my favorite functions for assessing Pairwise Relationships. So powerful. Run this code:

![GGally Pairwise Relationships](/assets/086_ggally.jpg)

## 6. DataExplorer: Generate a Full EDA Report

`DataExplorer` automates the EDA process and generates comprehensive reports. Run this code:

- I did a Deeper Dive on Data Explorer ([Get my deep-dive here.](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2021/03/02/use-dataexplorer-for-EDA.html))

## 7. summarytools: Summary Table for the Dataset

`summarytools` provides tools to neatly and quickly summarize data. Run this code:

- I did a deep dive on `summarytools` ([Get the deep dive here.](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2024/09/15/summarytools.html))
- I'm a big fan of `gt` tables, so I converted `summarytools` to gt ([get that article here.](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2024/09/22/gt-summarytools.html))

## 8. SmartEDA: Generate a Detailed EDA Report in HTML

`SmartEDA` creates automated EDA reports with detailed analyses. This is a newer package, but already I love it. Run this code:

## 9. janitor: Frequency Table for a Categorical Variable

`janitor` helps with data cleaning tasks, including frequency tables. We'll use `tabyl()` to create a frequency table and the `adorn_*` functions to modify the table. Run this code:

![Janitor Tabyl](/assets/086_janitor_tabyl.jpg)

## 10. inspectdf: Visualize Missing Values in the Dataset

`inspectdf` provides tools to visualize data frames, including missing values and correlations. Run this code:
