___Are you finding it difficult to show your organization results with data science?___

Then let me tell you a story from my consulting experience.

___Here's how I went from bad to good at data science consulting by learning 3 Simple Rules.___

---

## Data Science Consulting is Intense

Data Science Consulting is an intense role to be in. Businesses only care about one thing - Results!  If you can't deliver, you get cut.  

<mark>I wasn't always good at consulting. I got cut.</mark>

__This is a story about rebounding from failure.__

## My Bag of Tricks

I began data science consulting having a bag of tricks that I'd developed by through research and experimentation on a lot of business problems.   

In my research, I eventually stumbled upon 2 key packages that improved my abilities 10X.

___H2O + LIME___ - The combination was a powerful 1-2-punch that enabled me to get amazingly high model performance plus explainability in minutes.

### H2O Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) 

![H2O Automatic Machine Learning](/assets/2019-05-03-getting-results-with-data-science/h2o_automl.png)
<p class="date text-center">H2O Automatic Machine Learning - Get 30+ Models in Minutes</p>

H2O is great. The open source [__H2O AutoML Algorithm__](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) builds 30+ models in minutes, an efficiency that would take me hours or days to match. 

H2O quickly became a core tool in my toolbox. 

But, in business, ___explanations___ are most critical, which is what led me to...


### Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) 

![LIME](/assets/2019-05-03-getting-results-with-data-science/lime.png)
<p class="date text-center">LIME - Explain Business Insights</p>


I needed a way to convert the high-complexity models that H2O produced into results that the business could ___gain insights from___ (after all, without insights, I wasn't going to help the business very much). 

[__LIME__](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) turned out to be the perfect tool. LIME explained the H2O models so I could tell business people what levers they have available to adjust.

### Speed + Power + Explainability. Win-Win-Win.


![H2O + LIME](/assets/2019-05-03-getting-results-with-data-science/h2o_and_lime.jpg)
<p class="date text-center">LIME - Explain Business Insights</p>

The combo of ___H2O + LIME___ ended up being so good that I decided to commercialize it through offering a consulting service beyond just being a handy coder. 

This leads me to my first rule.

<br>

<p class="text-center" style="font-size:36px;color:blue;">Rule #1: Learn Tools That Deliver High Impact</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><em>The tools that have delivered the most impact for me in my career have hands-down been H2O and LIME. These are high-impact tools that deliver speed + power + explainability.</em></strong></p>

<br>

I began publishing what I was learning on the [__Business Science Blog (now Learning Hub)__](https://www.business-science.io/learn.html) as both a way to help others and also to get the word out that I could solve complex business problems with data science.

I wrote articles on [Human Resource Analytics / Employee Attrition](https://www.business-science.io/business/2017/09/18/hr_employee_attrition.html), [Customer Churn](https://www.business-science.io/business/2017/11/28/customer_churn_analysis_keras.html), [Sales Back Order Analysis](Predictive Sales Analytics: Use Machine Learning to Predict and Optimize Product Backorders) and more - Each of these diverse problems could all be solved by combining H2O and LIME.

## Next Is My Struggle

I eventually was noticed by a newly-appointed Director of HR working at a ___Fortune 500 Firm.___ She contacted me because of my [Business Science articles (now Learning Hub)](https://www.business-science.io/learn.html) - this was very exciting. 

As I took on my first major project with the Fortune 500 firm, I noticed that this engagement was different. 

I was given a ___very vague request___ (I later found out this is incredibly common):
 
>_"We have some HR data, we have a meeting with our Board in 1 week, and we want to show that we are implementing predictive analytics."_

>~Fortune 500 Firm

### What did I do? 

___I took the engagement confident I could deliver amazing results with my bag of tricks.___ 

I received the data on Friday, and was requested to have results Monday morning. 

I had hired an expert in the HR field to help me out, and we worked through the weekend to deliver a report with H2O + LIME.

### The Delivery

We delivered the executive report on Monday.

The report was awesome. It identified people that were not being currently identified as ___"executive leadership potential"___. It showed why they should be flagged for leadership potential.

We had our meeting on Monday. We delivered the report to the HR Exec's, gave them the results, and then there was...

<p class="text-center" style="color:red;">silence.</p>

For anyone delivering a data science product, __silence is NEVER a good thing__. 

### Epic Fail

<p class="text-center" style="color:red;"><strong>FAILURE.</strong> It's one of the most difficult things to deal with.</p>

It turns out they didn't like the report, and I never found out why.

I stopped taking on engagements. 

For days I just kept asking myself what I had done wrong. 

I hired an expert, I successfully applied predictive analytics to their data, my consultant and I turned around a great report in 3 days.

### What could it be?!?!

After about 10-days, it hit me like a ton of bricks:

1. I was operating without a process

2. I had an unrealistic time schedule

3. (__Most Importantly__) I had no clue what the client actually wanted (and I still don't).

This leads me to Rule #2.


<br>

<p class="text-center" style="font-size:36px;color:blue;">Rule #2: Learn From Failure</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><em>We all get knocked down. It's how we get back up. If you deconstruct your failures, you will learn, and you will be able to prevent future failures.</em></strong></p>


<br>

With an understanding of my failure in hand, I had the ingredients to build a system that would change my consulting performance overnight. 

This deconstruction of the failure spawned a major epiphany including the creation of __the most important Data Science Tool__ in my toolbox - [__The Business Science Problem Framework__](https://www.business-science.io/bspf.html).

<br>

<a href="https://www.business-science.io/bspf.html">
<img src="/assets/2019-05-03-getting-results-with-data-science/bspf.png" style="width:100%;"></a>

<p class="text-center date">The Most Important Tool in My Arsenal - <a href="https://www.business-science.io/bspf.html">The Business Science Problem Framework (Free Download)</a></p>

Do you want to hear something crazy?

<mark>I implemented the BSPF system as part of my consulting engagements, and overnight my client satisfaction skyrocketed!</mark>

## Why Was the BSPF So Effective?

There are really 3 reasons.

### First, the BSPF system laid out an entire plan for a data science project that clients understood.

Client's appreciate understanding the entire scope. The BSPF was a roadmap showing the direction we were headed. 

### Second, the BSPF showed every step in the process.

Client's saw the steps required for project success. Getting to project success was a team effort with stages and checkpoints to prevent project failure. They understood why it takes weeks to complete a data science project. 

### Third, the BSPF opened up the communication channel

Client's saw exactly where their input was needed, and why their input was so valuable to delivering a successful data science product. 


## A Good Plan + Stakeholder Input = Business Value

The bottom line was that the BSPF was delivering ___unparalleled value___ - client's were more satisfied than ever. 

This leads me to Rule #3


<br>

<p class="text-center" style="font-size:36px;color:blue;">Rule #3: Have a Plan that Incorporates Your Stakeholder's Problem Understanding</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><em>My struggle was because I didn't have a plan that took into account the stakeholder's input. Without this, my project was doomed from the beginning. Applying the BSPF changed my client's satisfaction overnight. </em></strong></p>

<br>

Fast forward to today...

## Nowadays I Teach Data Scientists

I see a lot of Data Scientists in my shoes. 

Data Scientists are finding it difficult to ___deliver business value___. 

This leads to a lot of...

## Frustration

The __most difficult part of data science__ is having an immense set of tools, but not knowing how to connect data science with the business.

The most common sources of frustration I see are...

### Which problems should I focus my efforts on?

The business is faced with an endless stream of challenges. Which ones should you take on and with what priority?

### Which algorithms should I use to solve a problem?

Some business challenges are not good candidates. Should you use data science to solve a problem? Where does machine learning fit? Which algorithm should you use?

### How do I explain data science to business stakeholders?

The business stakeholders are not typically proficient in the data science tools (that's your job). What are the stakeholders interested in? How can you convince the business to take on your __project__, to accept your __solution__, and to take your solution into __production__?


## What Helped Me Learn Data Science for Business?

One of the reasons __I enjoy consulting__ is that it allows me to work with the people that are on the ___front lines___ solving real problems that matter to the business. And I got to work with a lot of them. 

I was able to experience their <span style="color:red;"><strong>struggles</strong></span> and <span style="color:blue;"><strong>successes</strong></span>. 

This consulting experience has been very beneficial in understanding business problems and how to generate value within a diverse set of organizations. 

Now that I teach, I get to share my experience with you! :)

## I Began Offering My Knowledge Through Courses

I was drawn to education because I was helping organizations on a small level, but I _wanted_ to help data scientists on a larger level.

A natural extension was to create a course that addressed the needs of _Data Scientists_ seeking to apply data science within organizations to drive _business value_ (through __Return-On-Investment (ROI)__).


I focused on the __Business Consulting__ piece first because this is where I saw the ___biggest need___ within organizations.

Data Scientists were struggling. But with a little help, they could become amazing! They just needed to know what I knew - How to connect data science with business. 

### I created a course that detailed the Business Consulting + Machine Learning process from beginning to end 

<!-- <p class="pull-right" style="text-align:center">

# <p class="date text-center">Data Science Team Structure, Amadeus Investment Partners</p>
-->

Most Data Scientists needed to learn how to apply cutting-edge tools (i.e. __H2O and LIME__) to real Business Problems (i.e. __Churn__). So this is what I created. 

The product of a year of hard work was my [Data Science for Business with R (DS4B 201-R) Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover).

<p class="text-center">
<a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover"><img src="/img/course_logo_full_DS4B_201_R.png" class="img-rounded" alt="Data Science For Business With R Course" style="width:35%"/></a>
</p>

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover">Machine Learning + Business Consulting Course</a></p>



DS4B 201-R follows the exact same consulting framework that worked so well for me - The [__Business Science Problem Framework__](/bspf.html) - And the student applies the framework and machine learning to a real business problem.

This is an effective approach for a few reasons:

1. The student gains experience applying a ___repeatable methodology___ for generating business value through data science.

2. The student learns ___high-impact tools - H2O and LIME___

3. The course ___incorporates industry best practices___ - My learnings from failure, and years of experience consulting with many organizations.

But, it's when I launched DS4B 201-R that I began to understand the true impact.

## Real Results Through Applied Business Problem-Solving

The true measure of any course or solution is...

<br>

<p class="text-center" style="font-size:36px;color:blue;">Does It Deliver Results Fast?</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><em>If an educational program can't be applied within 1-hour of beginning, it's a waste of time.</em></strong></p>

<br>


The ___first major breakout result___ was when one of my students contacted me to explain his situation and what the course did for him.

![Course Feedback Rodrigo](/assets/2019-05-03-getting-results-with-data-science/course_feedback_rodrigo.png)

When I spoke with Rodrigo, he had already __applied the BSPF framework to 3 projects__. And he was using the tools, __H2O and LIME__, to solve client problems. 

The course ___doubled his productivity___ - He was able to complete data science projects in __half the time__!

You can check out the [__full interview here__](https://youtu.be/cLdr5GAboPw). 

## As Word-Of-Mouth Spread, The Results Continued

As word of mouth spread, we began getting more data scientists into the [DS4B 201-R program](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover), and more importantly we began gaining more feedback from students. 

___This feedback was critical.___

- Feedback led to improvements like the __Community Slack Channel__, where students are able to connect to each other.

- Feedback led to numerous other __iterative improvements__ that drove the course success - We have a survey at the end of Week 3 that has been completed by 90+ students.

Each student has an opportunity to provide feedback. I personally read every response.

Our overall rating for DS4B 201-R is a 9 of 10, which is amazing!

<br>

<p class="text-center" style="font-size:36px;color:blue;">9 of 10 Rating</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong><em>Feedback is critical to improvement. Progress happened iteratively. We improved overall feedack over time to a 9 of 10 rating (90+ ratings), which is very good for an advanced data science course.</em></strong></p>

<br>

But, the details of the responses were more amazing... 

## Data Scientist are confidently applying data science to business

More recently we began seeing results like Ben Moretti's.

![Course Feedback Ben Moretti](/assets/2019-05-03-getting-results-with-data-science/course_feedback_ben_moretti.png)

Ben was ___apprehensive___ about applying data science to business. 

He took our [DS4B 201-R course](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover), and learned the BSPF Framework and H2O. __Ben's confidence increased__. He now was able to apply a repeatable system and tools to generate business value. 

## Conclusion

I've learned a lot on my data science journey. I've made mistakes, I've improved through trial and error, and I've become a much better data scientist because of it. 

If I boil this learning down, I can sum it up into __3 Simple Rules__:

1. __Learn Tools That Deliver High Impact__ - For me and many other data scientists, these are H2O and LIME. It's a powerful one-two punch for high performance and explainability, both of which help generate business value.

2. __Learn From Failure__ - When your projects fail, learn from it. Deconstruct the problem. Find out why. Figure out what could have been done differently. Implement it!

3. __Have a Plan that Incorporates Your Stakeholder's Problem Understanding__ - A tool like the Business Science Problem Framework is priceless because it gets everyone on the same page while showing them a roadmap for the entire problem-solving process. 

Finally, just because you are learning ___does not mean that you have to go at it alone___. You can accelerate and improve by learning from others that have been there. That's where I fit in.

I will help.
