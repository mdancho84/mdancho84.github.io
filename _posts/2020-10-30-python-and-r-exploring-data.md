<h2> Introduction </h2>

<img src="/assets/2020-10-30-python-and-r-exploring-data/data_table.png" align="right" style="margin-left:7px; max-width:400px;" />

Python‚Äôs `datatable` was launched by `h2o` two years ago and is still in alpha stage with cautions that it may still be unstable and features may be missing or incomplete. We found that it feels very similar to the R version, with a few syntax differences and also some important pieces still to be added (as we will discuss). We could only find a handful of posts showing how to use `datatable`, and many of the examples we were probably not written by regular users of R `data.table`, and were often focused on its efficiency and ability to scale relative to pandas. We use R `data.table` every day and love the speed and concise syntax, so this walk-through analysis of the _EPA‚Äôs Big MT_ cars data set will be on the syntax of the most frequent actual data exploration operations. As for plotnine, it feels more seamless with `ggplot2` with a few problems formatting plots in Rmarkdown.

<h2> EPA‚Äôs Big MT Dataset </h2>

To make it a little interesting, we will use the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-15"> Tidy Tuesday Big MT Cars </a> with 36 years of 42,230 new US car models. The data dictionary with 83 variables describing each annual new car model is found <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#fuelType1">here</a>. Everyone loves cars and remembering historical models, and we have naturally been curious about this data set. After closer analysis however, we discovered that there are some unfortunate missing pieces.

When we have modeled _mtcars_, weight (wt) and horsepower (hp), and their interaction, have been most informative for predicting mpg. It would have been interesting to look at the evolution of the _mtcars_ coefficients over time, but these variables are not unfortunately not available. In addition, it is hard to get a sense of fleet mileage without the annual unit-volume of each new car model. Because of this, it is impossible to know the evolution of more fuel efficient electric vehicles relative to more fuel-hungry model sales.

It is difficult to understand why these variables are not included when that information must be available to the EPA, and it clearly says on page 6 of <a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/guides/FEG2020.pdf"> Fuel Economy Guide 2020 </a> that an extra 100 lbs decreases fuel economy by 1%. While the data set is still of interest to practice for data cleaning, it doesn‚Äôt look likely that we will be able replicate mtcars over time unless we can find more variables.

<h2> Loading Data with fread </h2>

{% highlight r %}
# R Libraries
library("reticulate")
library("skimr")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 15,
  fig.height = 8,
  out.width = '100%')
{% endhighlight r %}


{% highlight r %} 
# Install Python packages
lapply(c("datatable", "pandas"), function(package) {
       conda_install("r-reticulate", package, pip = TRUE)
})
{% endhighlight r %}


{% highlight r %}
# Python libraries
from datatable import *
import numpy as np
import re
import pprint
{% endhighlight r %}

<br>

We tried to download both the origin zipped data directly from the EPA website (see link below), and the _.csv_ from the Tidy Tuesday website, but were unsuccessful in both cases using Python and R versions of fread. We were able to download the Tidy Tuesday _.csv_ link with _fread_ in `data.table` but not `datatable`, and the error message didn‚Äôt give us enough information to figure it out. The documentation for `data.table` fread is among the most extensive of any function we know, while still thin for datatable's version so far. In the end, we manually downloaded and unzipped the file from the EPA‚Äôs website, and uploaded from our local drive.

The list of all 83 variables below, and we can see that there are several pertaining to fuel efficiency, emissions, fuel type, range, volume and some of the same attributes that we all know from _mtcars_ (ie: cylinders, displacement, make, model and transmission). As mentioned, gross horsepower and weight are missing, but carburetors, acceleration and engine shape are also absent. We have all classes of vehicles sold, so get vehicle class information (_VClass_) not available in _mtcars_ which is only cars. We will discuss further down, changes to the weight cutoffs on some of the categories over time make _VClass_ of questionable use.

<h2> Set-up Thoughts from R Perspective </h2>

There were a couple of things about the set-up for `datatable`, which weren‚Äôt apparent coming over from `data.table` as an R user. The first was to use `from dt import *` at the outset to avoid having to reference the package short name every time within the frame. From a Python perspective, this is considered bad practice, but we are only going to do it for that one package because it makes us feel more at home. The second was to use `export_names()` in order to skip having to use the f operator or quotation marks to reference variables. In order to do this, we had to create a dictionary of names using the names list from above, and each of their f expressions extracted with `export_names` in a second list. We then used update from the local environment to assign all of the dictionary values to their keys as variables. From then on, we can refer to those variable without quotation marks or the f operator (although any new variables created would still need f or quotation marks). We weren‚Äôt sure why this is not the default behavior, but it is easily worked around for our purposes. These two possibly not ‚ÄúPythonic‚Äù steps brought the feel of `datatable` a lot closer to the usual R `data.table` (ie: without the package and expression short codes).



<h2> Basic Filter and Select Operations </h2>

A few lines of some key variables are shown in the code below, and it is clear that they need significant cleaning to be of use. One difference with R `data.table` can be seen below with filtering. Using our `year_filter` in i (the first slot), the 1204 2019 models are shown below. Unlike R `data.table`, we refer to year outside of the frame in an expression, and then call it within i of the frame. The columns can be selected within `()` or `[]` in _j_ (the second slot) as shown below, and new columns can be created within `{}`.


{% highlight r %}
# Key variables for year 2019
year_filter = (year == 2020)
print(big_mt[year_filter, (year, make, model, trany, evMotor, VClass)])
{% endhighlight r %}

We usually like to make a quick check if there are any duplicated rows across the whole our dataFrame, but there isn‚Äôt a `duplicated()` function yet in datatable. According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61578175/how-to-find-unique-values-for-a-field-in-pydatatable-data-frame">How to find unique values for a field in Pydatatable Data Frame</a>, the `unique()` function also doesn‚Äôt apply to groups yet. In order to work around this, identifying variables would have to be grouped, counted and filtered for equal to 1, but we weren‚Äôt sure yet exactly which variables to group on. We decided to pipe over to pandas to verify with a simple line of code that there were no duplicates, but hope this function will be added in the future. 



<h2> Aggregate New Variable and Sort </h2>


We can see that below that `eng_dscr` is unfortunately blank 38% of the time, and high cardinality for the rest of the levels. A small percentage are marked _‚ÄúGUZZLER‚Äù_ and _‚ÄúFLEX FUELS‚Äù_. in a few cases, potentially helpful information about engine like V-6 or V-8 are included with very low frequency, but not consistently enough to make sense try to extract. Another potentially informative variable, `trans_dscr` is similarly blank more than 60% of the time. It seems unlikely that we could clean these up to make it useful in an analysis, so will probably have to drop them.



{% highlight r %}
print(big_mt[:, {'percent' : int32(count() * 100/big_mt.nrows) }, by(eng_dscr)]\
            [:,:, sort(-f.percent)])

<h2> Separate and Assign New Variables </h2>

As shown above, `trany` has both the transmission-type and gear-speed variables within it, so we extracted the variable from big_mt with `to_list()`, drilled down one level, and used regex to extract the transmission and gear information needed out into trans and gear. Notice that we needed to convert the lists back into columns with dt.Frame before assigning as new variables in big_mt.

In the third line of code, we felt like we were using an R `data.table`. The `{}` is used group by _trans_ and _gear_, and then to create the new _percent_ variable in-line, without affecting the other variables in _big_mt_. We tried to round the decimals in percent, but couldn‚Äôt figure it out so far. Our understanding is that there is no `round()` method yet for `datatable`, so we multiplied by 100 and converted to integer. We again called `export_names()`, to be consistent in using non-standard evaluation with the two new variables. 



{% highlight r %}
big_mt['trans'] = Frame([re.sub('[\s\(].*$','', s) for s in big_mt[:, 'trany'].to_list()[0]])
big_mt['gear'] = Frame([re.sub('A\w+\s|M\w+\s','', s) for s in big_mt[:, 'trany'].to_list()[0]])
gear, trans= big_mt[:, ('gear', 'trans')].export_names()

# Summarize percent of instances by transmission and speed
print(big_mt[:, { 'percent' : int32(count() * 100 /big_mt.nrows) }, by(trans, gear)]\
            [0:13, : , sort(-f.percent)])

<h2> Set Key and Join </h2>

We wanted to create a Boolean variable to denote if a vehicle had an electric motor or not. We again used `{}` to create the variable in the frame, but don‚Äôt think it is possible to update by reference so still had to assign to _is_ev_. In the table below, we show the number of electric vehicles rising from 3 in 1998 to 149 this year. Unfortunately,


{% highlight r %}
# Create 'is_ev' within the frame
big_mt['is_ev'] = big_mt[:, { 'is_ev' : evMotor != '' }]
is_ev = big_mt[:, 'is_ev'].export_names()
ann_models = big_mt[:, {'all_models' : count()}, by(year)]
ev_models = big_mt[:, {'ev_models' : count() }, by('year', 'is_ev')]\
                  [(f.is_ev == 1), ('year', 'ev_models')]
ev_models.key = "year"
print(ann_models[:, :, join(ev_models)]\
                [:, { 'all_models' : f.all_models, 
                      'ev_models' : f.ev_models, 
                      'percent' : int32(f.ev_models * 100 / f.all_models) },

<h2> Using Regular Expressions in Row Operations </h2>

Next, we hoped to extract wheel-drive (2WD, AWD, 4WD, etc) and engine type (ie: V4, V6, etc) from model. The `re_match()` function is helpful in filtering rows in i. As shown below, we found almost 17k matches for wheel drive, but only 718 for the engine size. Given that we have over 42k rows, we will extract the wheels and give up on the engine data. It still may not be enough data for wheels to be a helpful variable.


{% highlight r %}

# Regex match with re_match()
print('%d of rows with wheels info.' % (big_mt[model.re_match('.*(.WD).*'), model].nrows))

{% endhighlight r %}

{% highlight r %}

## 16921 of rows with wheels info.

{% endhighlight r %}

{% highlight r %}

print('%d of rows with engine info.' % (big_mt[model.re_match('.*(V|v)(\s|\-)?\d+.*'), model].nrows))

{% endhighlight r %}

{% highlight r %}

## 718 of rows with engine info.
{% endhighlight r %}

We used regex to extract whether the model was _2WD_, _4WD_, etc as _wheels_ from _model_, but most of the time, it was the same information as we already had in drive. It is possible that our weakness in Python is at play, but this would have been a lot simpler in R, because we wouldn‚Äôt have iterated over every row in order to extract part of the row with regex. We found that there were some cases where the 2WD and 4WD were recorded as 2wd and 4wd. The `replace()` function was an efficient solution to this problem, replacing matches of _‚Äòwd‚Äô_ with _‚ÄòWD‚Äô_ over the entire frame.



{% highlight r %}
# Extract 'wheels' and 'engine' from 'model'
reg = re.compile(r'(.*)(.WD|4x4)(.*)', re.IGNORECASE)
big_mt[:, 'wheels'] = Frame([reg.match(s).group(2) if reg.search(s) else '' for s in big_mt[:, model].to_list()[0]])
wheels = big_mt[:, 'wheels'].export_names()

# Fix problem notations
big_mt.replace("\dwd", "\dWD")

# Summarize total count for all years
cols = ['make', 'model', 'cylinders', 'wheels', 'drive']
print(big_mt[(f.wheels != ''), cols]\
            [:, count(), by(f.wheels, cylinders, drive)]\
            [0:14:, :, sort(-f.count)])

<h2> Reshaping </h2> 

There was no such thing as an 4-wheel drive SUVs back in the 80‚Äôs, and we remember the big 8-cylinder Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, so were curious how these models evolved over time. datatable doesn‚Äôt yet have `dcast()` or `melt()`, so we had to pipe these out `to_pandas()` and then use `pivot_table()`. Its likely that a lot of the the many models where wheel-drive was unspecified were _2WD_, which is still the majority of models. We would have liked to show these as whole numbers, and there is a workaround in datatable to convert to integer, but once we pivoted in `pandas`, it reverted to float. We can see the first _AWD_ models starting in the late 80s, and the number of 8-cylinder cars fall by half. There are are a lot fewer annual new car models now than in the 80s, but were surprised how many fewer 4-cylinders.

<h2> Combining Levels of Variables with High Cardinality </h2>

With 35 distinct levels often referring to similar vehicles, _VClass_ also needed to be cleaned up. Even in R `data.table`, we have been keenly awaiting the implementation of `fcase`, a `data.table` version of the `dplyr case_when()` function for nested control-flow statements. We made a separate 16-line function to lump factor levels (not shown). In the first line below, we created the vclasses list to drill down on the _VClass_ tuple elements as strings. In the second line, we had to iterate over the resulting strings from the 0-index of the tuple to extract wheel-drive from a list-comprehension. We printed out the result of our much smaller list of lumped factors, but there are still problems with the result. The EPA changed the cutoff for a ‚ÄúSmall Pickup Truck‚Äù from 4,500 to 6,000 lbs in 2008, and also used a higher cut-off for ‚Äúsmall‚Äù SUV‚Äôs starting in 2011. This will make it pretty hard to us _VClass_ as a consistent variable for modeling, at least for Pickups and SUVs. As noted earlier, if we had the a weight field, we could have easily worked around this.


{% highlight r %}
# Clean up vehicle type from VClass
vclasses = [tup[0] for tup in big_mt[:, 'VClass'].to_tuples()]
big_mt['VClass'] = Frame([re.sub('\s\dWD$|\/\dwd$|\s\-\s\dWD$', '', x) if re.search(r'WD$|wd$', x) is not None else x for x in vclasses])
big_mt['VClass'] = Frame([collapse_vclass(line[0]) for line in big_mt[:, 'VClass'].to_tuples()])

<h2>Selecting Multiple Columns with Regex </h2>

In the chunk (below), we show how to select columns from the big_mt names tuple by creating the measures selector using regex matches for the key identifier columns and for integer mileage columns matching ‚Äò08‚Äô. This seemed complicated and we couldn‚Äôt do it in line within the frame as we would have with `data.table` .SD = patterns(). We also wanted to reorder to move the identifier columns (year, make and model) to the left side of the table, but couldn‚Äôt find a equivalent `setcolorder` function. There is documentation about multi-column selection, but we couldn‚Äôt figure out an efficient way to make it work. We show the frame with the `year_filter` which we set up earlier.

{% highlight r %}
# Regex search for variable selection
measures = [name for name in big_mt.names if re.search(r'make|model|year|08$', name)]

# Print remaining cols with measures filter
print(big_mt[year_filter,  measures])

<h2> Selecting Columns and Exploring Summary Data </h2>

We looked for a Python version of `skimr`, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like there is an similar library (as is often the case). We tried out `pandas profiling`, but that had a lot of dependencies and seemed like overkill for our purposes, so decided to use `skim_tee` on the table in a separate R chunk (below). It was necessary to convert to `pandas` in the Python chunk (above), because we couldn‚Äôt figure out how to translate a `datatable` back to a `data.frame` via `reticulate` in the R chunk.

When we did convert, we discovered there were some problems mapping NA‚Äôs which we will show below. We suspect it isn‚Äôt possible to pass a `datatable` to `data.table`, and this might be the first functionality we would vote to add. There is a sizable community of `data.table` users who are used to the syntax, and as we are, might be looking to port into Python (rather than learn `pandas` directly). As `reticulate` develops, opening this door seems to make so much sense. Below, we again run `export_names()` in order to also prepare the newly generated variables for non-standard evaluation within the frame, and then filtered for the 21 columns we wanted to keep.

In the result above, we see a lot of challenges if we had hoped to have appropriate data to build a model to predict mpg over time. Many variables, such as evMotor, tCharger, sCharger and guzzler, are only available in a small number of rows. When we set out on this series, we hoped we would be able to experiment with modeling gas mileage for every year just like mtcars, but that seems unlikely based on the available variables.


<h2> Conclusion </h2> 

It took us a couple of months to get up and running with R `data.table`, and even with daily usage, we are still learning its nuance a year later. We think the up-front investment in learning the syntax, which can be a little confusing at first, has been worth it. It is also less well documented than dplyr or pandas. We learned so much about `data.table` from a few blog posts such as <a href="http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog/articles/advanced-data-table/">Advanced tips and tricks with data.table</a> and <a href="https://atrebas.github.io/post/2019-03-03-datatable-dplyr/">A data.table and dplyr tour</a>. The goal of this post is to help to similarly fill the gap for `datatable`.

Python `datatable` is promising, and we are grateful for it as familiar territory as we learn Python. We can‚Äôt tell how much of our difficulty has been because the package is not as mature as `data.table` or our just inexperience with Python. The need to manually set variables for non-standard evaluation, to revert to pandas to accomplish certain tasks (ie: reshaping) or the challenges extracting and filtering data from nested columns. It was still not easy to navigate the documentation and there were areas where the documentation was not Also, it would be appreciated to seamlessly translate between a `datatable` and `data.table`.
