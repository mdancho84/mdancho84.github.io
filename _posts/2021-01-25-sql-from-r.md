## Writing SQL from R

![](/assets/2021-01-25-sql-from-r/generate-sql-from-r.jpg)

We're going to **generate SQL from R** using 3 key packages:
- `DBI` - For connecting to & working with databases
- `RSQLite` - For working with the SQLite-variety of database
- `tidyverse` - Gives us `dbplyr` - the database-backened to dplyr - FOR FREE!! OMG!


<h2>Step 1: Connect to database<br><small>Use DBI to make a connection</small></h2>

DBI has the `dbConnect()` function. Let's use this to establish a connection with our SQL database.

**Examine the connection.** You should see a connection object has been created and the SQL database has one table named "MPG".

<h2>Step 2: Write Dplyr, Generate SQL<br>
<small>Use the dbplyr backend to auto-magically create SQL for us.</small></h2>

DBI has the `show_query()` function we can use to generate SQL...

...and here's the result!
