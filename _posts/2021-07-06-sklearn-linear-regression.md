# Project: Making a Regression Trendline Plot

Let's check out how to make a professional __regression trendline plot__ with `Scikit Learn`.

</p>

## Step 1: Load Libraries and Data

First, let's load the libraries and data. From the libraries, we'll import `numpy` and `pandas` along with `LinearRegression` and `r2_score` from `sklearn` to start out.  

![Libraries](/assets/2021-07-06-sklearn/00_libraries.jpg)

</p>

We'll also load the `mpg_df` data set.

## Step 2: Fit the Linear Regression Model

> Goal: Understand the relationship between Fuel Economy (MPG) and Vehicle Weight. 

Next, we can assess the relationship between vehicle fuel economy and vehicle weight using a Linear Regression Model. We fit the model first.  

### Code

We'll use the `LinearRegression()` method from `sklearn.linear_model` to train a Linear Regression Model. This is the same process as in the _Sklearn Documentation_ for OLS Regression.

</p>

## Step 3: Making Predictions

We can use the trained (fitted) Linear Regression Model to make predictions. Simply call the `predict()` method on a Pandas Data Frame containing vehicle weights. A Numpy Array is returned with predictions for the vehicle fuel economy (MPG).

</p>

## Step 4: Visualize with Plotnine

The last step is to visualize the relationship between fuel economy and vehicle weight. We can use `plotnine`. 

![Making Predictions](/assets/2021-07-06-sklearn/03_plotnine_code.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

The visualization that is return clearly shows an inverse trend between vehicle fuel economy and weight.

# Summary

This was a short introduction to `Scikit Learn`, which is a foundational machine learning and modeling library in Python. We saw how we can use `sklearn` to make a linear regression model, and visualize the model prediction as a relationship with `plotnine`.  


But, this was a simple problem and you're eventually going to want to solve real-world problems that are much more complex:

- Most data science projects require much more data wrangling, visualization and reporting.

- Most data science teams use Pandas and Scikit Learn

- Many organizations are transitioning to automations (producing reports and data insights on-demand)


So, it makes sense to eventually learn Pandas and Scikit Learn to help with communication and working on R/Python teams. 

If you'd like to learn data science for business with `Pandas`, `Sktime`, `Plotnine`, and more Python packages then read on. ðŸ‘‡
