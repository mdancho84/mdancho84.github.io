__Quite often our student feedback leads to BIG IMPROVEMENTS in our courses and big developments that help everyone!__ This is a perfect example. Based on student feedback, we've completely upgraded the Week 6 materials in our foundational [Business Analysis with R Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r/?coupon=ds4b15) creating a __BRAND NEW CHEAT SHEET on Customer Segmentation__ in the process. We've open sourced the NEW CHEAT SHEET,  which is available for [download below](#cheatsheet). __Read on__ to find out why we created the cheat sheet, how it works, and how it helps you.

## Creation of the Cheat Sheet - How a Student Spoke and We Listened {#creation}

As a course instructor and creator, there is nothing more valuable than constructive feedback from our students. This helps big time. __Here's a prime example of what one student said, and how it improved the course.__

Last, week I released the first part of the Modeling section in our [__Business Analysis with R course__](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r/?coupon=ds4b15), which covers __Customer Segmentation with K-Means and UMAP__ - 2 important techniques for data mining based on customer similarity. It's a nerve-wracking experience launching new material, and the initial feedback is critical to understanding if I hit the mark. 
 
### "This Week Just Felt Different"

One of my students contacted me. His point was that the modeling section didn't match the feel of the previous weeks. He loved how weeks 1 through 5 used Cheat Sheets to explain subjects building on each other, and how they were interwoven into the lessons. He loved how the key concepts built on each other. 

He said, _"this week just felt different"_. 

For me, the course creator, this is something that I really wanted to address, ___especially if my goal is to truly make the #1 most effective applied data science education___. 
 
### Digestion, Reflection, and Solution!

I took this week to digest the comment and get to the root of the problem. After speaking with the student over our Slack Channel, we nailed down the problem.

The student needed me to make the process repeatable. He said, _"I valued the content, I just don't think I could apply it"_. Bingo!

Now that I understood the problem, I needed to figure out a solution with his input. What we decided to do was:

1. __Create a new Cheat Sheet (Segmentation and Clustering Workflow)__ that covered the high-level concepts, summarized popular algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, tSNE, UMAP), code examples, and most importantly a 2nd page that covers the step-by-step workflow for applying clustering to segment customers/companies.

2. __Create a new Challenge (Company Segmentation using Stock Prices)__ that reinforced the learning where the student applies the material. We settled on an exciting Company Segmentation Project using Stock Prices to cluster similar companies based on their stock price movement. 

### What did our student think?

And here's what he is referring to - Page 2 that summarizes the workflow.

<p style="font-size:30px;">The input from our student was critical. <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Sometimes we miss the mark, and we need to course correct.</span></p>
