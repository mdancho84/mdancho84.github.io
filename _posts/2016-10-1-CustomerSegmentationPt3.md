This post is the third and final part in the customer segmentation analysis. The [first post](http://www.mattdancho.com/business/2016/08/07/CustomerSegmentationPt1.html) focused on [_K_-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to segment customers into distinct groups based on purchasing habits. The second post takes a different approach, using [Pricipal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to visualize customer groups. The third and final post performs [Network Visualization (Graph Drawing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing) using the `igraph` and `networkD3` libraries as a method to visualize the customer connections and relationship strengths.

## Why Network Visualization? <a class="anchor" id="network-vis"></a>

According to [Katya Ognyanova](http://kateto.net/), an expert in network theory, Network Visualization is a useful technique for viewing relationships in the data, with the key benefits being identification of the following:

<p class="text-center date">Source: <a href="http://kateto.net/network-visualization">Network Visualization with R</a></p>

For customer segmentation, we can utilize network visualization to understand both the network communities and the strength of the relationships. Before we jump into network visualization, it's a good idea to review where we left off in the previous customer segmentation posts.

## Where We Left Off <a class="anchor" id="left-off"></a>

In the [first post](http://www.mattdancho.com/business/2016/08/07/CustomerSegmentationPt1.html), we used _k_-means clustering to analyze the `bikes data set`, a collection of excel files that contains data for bike shops (customers), bikes (products), and sales orders for the bike manufacturer, [_Cannondale_](http://www.cannondale.com/). The bike shops and sales orders are fictional / simulated (see the [orderSimulatoR post](http://www.mattdancho.com/business/2016/07/12/orderSimulatoR.html) for more on this), but the bikes (products) are actual models from _Cannondale's_ website. 

A hypothesis was formed that bike shops purchase bikes based on bike features such as unit price (high end vs affordable), primary category (Mountain vs Road), frame (aluminum vs carbon), etc. The sales orders were combined with the customer and product information and grouped to form a matrix of sales by model and customer. The `kmeans()` function was run on a range of potential clusters, _k_, and the `silhouette()` function from the `cluster` package was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

In the [second post](http://www.mattdancho.com/business/2016/09/04/CustomerSegmentationPt2.html), we used PCA to visually examine the customer segments using the `prcomp()` function in base `R`. PCA visualization allowed us to identify a customer segment that k-means failed to pick up. 

## Getting Ready for Network Visualization <a class="anchor" id="getting-ready"></a>

For those that would like to follow along, rather than run through the previous posts the sections below can be used to get everything ready for network visualization.

#### Getting the Data <a class="anchor" id="get-data"></a>

You can access the data [here](https://github.com/mdancho84/orderSimulatoR/tree/master/data) if you would like to follow along. You'll need to download the following files:

  * __orders.xlsx__: Contains the fictional sales orders for _Cannondale_. `customer.id` in the __orders.xlsx__ file relates to `bike shop.id` in the __bikeshops.xlsx__ file, and `product.id` in the __orders.xlsx__ file relates to `bike.id` in the __bikes.xlsx__ file.
  
  * __bikes.xlsx__:  Contains information on products (e.g. bike model, primary category, secondary category, unit price, etc). `bike.id` is the primary key.
  
  * __bikeshops.xlsx__: Contains information on customers (e.g. customer name and location). `bikeshop.id` is the primary key. 

The script to load and configure the data into a customer trends matrix is shown below. 

#### Reading the Data <a class="anchor" id="read-data"></a>

This script will read the data. Make sure you have the excel files in a folder named "data" in your current working directory prior to running the script below.


{% highlight r %}
# Read Cannondale orders data --------------------------------------------------
library(xlsx)   # Used to read bikes data set
customers <- read.xlsx2("./data/bikeshops.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1,
                       colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "character",
                                      "character", "character", "numeric"))
products <- read.xlsx2("./data/bikes.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1,
                        colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "character",
                                       "character", "character", "numeric"))
orders <- read.xlsx2("./data/orders.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1, colIndex = 2:7,
                     colClasses = c("numeric", "numeric", "Date", "numeric",
                                    "numeric", "numeric"))
{% endhighlight %}

#### Manipulating the Data <a class="anchor" id="manipulate-data"></a>

The script below combines the `orders`, `customers` and `products` data frames into `orders.extended`, which is a data frame that simulates output we would get from an SQL query of a sales orders database / ERP system. The data is then manipulated to form `customerTrends`, which has the data structured such that the rows contain products and the columns contain purchase quantity (as percentage of total) by customer. 


{% highlight r %}
# Step 1: Combine orders, customers, and products data frames ------------------
library(dplyr)
orders.extended <- merge(orders, customers, by.x = "customer.id", by.y="bikeshop.id")
orders.extended <- merge(orders.extended, products, by.x = "product.id", by.y = "bike.id")
orders.extended <- orders.extended %>%
  mutate(price.extended = price * quantity) %>%
  select(order.date, order.id, order.line, bikeshop.name, model,
         quantity, price, price.extended, category1, category2, frame) %>%
  arrange(order.id, order.line)

# Step 2: Group by model & model features, summarize by quantity purchased -----
library(tidyr)  # For spread function
customerTrends <- orders.extended %>%
  group_by(bikeshop.name, model, category1, category2, frame, price) %>%
  summarise(total.qty = sum(quantity)) %>%
  spread(bikeshop.name, total.qty)
customerTrends[is.na(customerTrends)] <- 0  # Remove NA's

# Step 3: Convert price to binary high/low category ----------------------------
library(Hmisc)  # Needed for cut2 function
customerTrends$price <- cut2(customerTrends$price, g=2)

# Step 4: Convert customer purchase quantity to percentage of total quantity ---
customerTrends.mat <- as.matrix(customerTrends[,-(1:5)])  # Drop first five columns
customerTrends.mat <- prop.table(customerTrends.mat, margin = 2)  # column-wise pct
customerTrends <- bind_cols(customerTrends[,(1:5)], as.data.frame(customerTrends.mat))
{% endhighlight %}

Note that if the code above seems confusing, I recommend stepping through each step in the code chunk separately, then stopping to view the data frame that is created. the intention is to build the orders data frame and then convert it into a data frame that relates customers to the product purchase history.

Here's the first 6 rows of `customerTrends`:


{% highlight r %}
customerTrends %>% head() %>% knitr::kable() # First 6 rows
{% endhighlight %}

## Developing the Network Visualization <a class="anchor" id="applying"></a>

Going from the `customerTrends` to a network visualization requires three main steps:

1. [Create a Cosine Similarity Matrix](#cosine)
2. [Prune the Tree](#prune)
3. [Create the iGraph](#igraph)

### Step 1: Create a Cosine Similarity Matrix <a class="anchor" id="cosine"></a>
 
The first step to network visualization is to get the data organized into a cosine similarity matrix. A similarity matrix is a way of numerically representing the similarity between multiple variables similar to a correlation matrix. We'll use [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to measure the relationship, which measures how similar the direction of a vector is to another vector. If that seems complicated, just think of a _customer cosine similarity_ as a number that reflects how closely the _direction of buying habits are related_. Numbers will range from zero to one with numbers closer to one indicating very similar buying habits and numbers closer to zero indicating dissimilar buying habits. 

Implementing the cosine similarity matrix is quite easy since we already have our `customerTrends` data frame organized relating customers (columns) to product purchases (rows). We'll use the `cosine()` function from the `lsa` library, and this will calculate all of the cosine similarities for the entire matrix of `customerTrends.mat`. Make sure to use the `matrix` version of customer trends (`customerTrends.mat`) because the data frame version needs to be vectorized to work with the `cosine()` function. Also, set the diagonal of the matrix to zero since showing a customer perfectly related to itself is of no significance (and it will mess up the network visualization).


{% highlight r %}
# Create adjacency matrix using cosine similarity ------------------------------
library(lsa) # for cosine similarity matrix
simMatrix <- cosine(customerTrends.mat)
diag(simMatrix) <- 0 # Remove relationship with self
simMatrix %>% head() %>% knitr::kable() # Show first 6 rows
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 2: Prune the Tree <a class="anchor" id="prune"></a>

It's a good idea to prune the tree before we move to graphing. The network graphs can become quite messy if we do not limit the number of edges. We do this by reviewing the cosine similarity matrix and selecting an `edgeLimit`, a number below which the cosine similarities will be replaced with zero. This keeps the highest ranking relationships while reducing the noise. We select 0.70 as the limit, but typically this is a trial and error process. If the limit is too high, the network graph will not show enough detail. Try testing different edge limits to see what looks best in Step 3.


{% highlight r %}
# Prune edges of the tree
edgeLimit <- .70
simMatrix[(simMatrix < edgeLimit)] <- 0
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 3: Create the iGraph <a class="anchor" id="igraph"></a>

Creating the `igraph` is easy with the `graph_from_adjacency_matrix()` function. Just pass the pruned `simMatrix`. We can also get the communities by passing the `simMatrix` to the `cluster_edge_betweenness()` function. 


{% highlight r %}
library(igraph)
simIgraph <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(simMatrix, 
                                         mode = 'undirected', 
                                         weighted = T)
ceb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(simIgraph) # For community detection
{% endhighlight %}

Let's pause to take a look as the cluster edge betweenness (`ceb`). We can view a plot of the clusters by passing `ceb` to the `dendPlot()` function. Set the `mode` to "hclust" to view as a hierarchical clustered dendrogram (it uses `hclust` from the `stats` library). We can see that the cluster edge betweenness has detected three distinct clusters.


{% highlight r %}
dendPlot(ceb, mode="hclust")
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7](/figure/source/2016-10-1-CustomerSegmentationPt3/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

Now we can plot the network graph by passing `ceb` and `simIgraph` to the `plot()` function. See `plot.igraph` for additional documentation.


{% highlight r %}
plot(x=ceb, y=simIgraph)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8](/figure/source/2016-10-1-CustomerSegmentationPt3/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

Yikes. This is a little difficult to read. With that said, the graph did a nice job of showing the major customer segments. Also notice how the color of the node clusters match the dendrogram groupings. For readability sake, we'll take a look at what the `networkD3` package has to offer.

## Visualizing the Results with NetworkD3 <a class="anchor" id="visualizing-results"></a>

The `networkD3` library enables D3 JavaScript network graphs from `R`. It has an `igraph_to_networkD3()` function that can be used to seamlessly convert an `igraph` object to `network3D`. The benefits to D3 are interactivity:

* The names are hidden until the user hovers over the node, improving readability.
* Nodes can be dragged to manipulate the network graph for easier viewing.
* Zoom is enabled, allowing the user to zero-in on specific nodes to more easily see the edges and thus better understand relationships.


{% highlight r %}
# Use igraph ceb to find membership
members <- membership(ceb)

# Convert to object suitable for networkD3
simIgraph_d3 <- igraph_to_networkD3(simIgraph, group = members)

# Create force directed network plot
forceNetwork(Links = simIgraph_d3$links, Nodes = simIgraph_d3$nodes, 
             Source = 'source', Target = 'target', 
             NodeID = 'name', Group = 'group', 
             fontSize = 16, fontFamily = 'Arial', linkDistance = 100,
             zoom = TRUE)
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion <a class="anchor" id="conclusions"></a>

Network visualization is an excellent way to view and understand interrelationships between customers. Network graphs are particularly useful as the data scales, as they can be pruned and viewed interactively to zero-in on complex relationships. We've all heard the saying a picture is worth a thousand words. A network graph could be worth many more as customers go from 30 in our example to hundreds, thousands or even millions. 

## Recap <a class="anchor" id="recap"></a>

This post expanded on our customer segmentation methodology by adding network graphing to our tool set. We manipulated our sales order data to obtain a format that relates products to customer purchases. We created a cosine similarity matrix using the `cosine()` function from the `lsa` library, and we used this as the foundation for our network graph. We "pruned the tree" to remove edges with low significance. We used the `igraph` library to create an igraph with communities shown. Finally, we converted the igraph to an interactive graph using the `networkD3` package. Pretty impressive, and hopefully you see that it's not that difficult with a basic knowledge of `R` programming.
