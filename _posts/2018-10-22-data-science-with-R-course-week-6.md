Welcome to week 6 of the <i>Data Science with R Course Series</i>. 

This week’s curriculum is an extension of [week 5](https://www.business-science.io/university/2018/10/15/data-science-with-R-course-week-5.html), where we started analyzing model performance. 

This week will cover the following:

- Learn techniques to __communicate and measure model performance__
- Learn how to __analyze individual machine learning model metrics__
- Learn how to visually __compare multiple models__ based on metrics
- Learn how to __communicate model performance__ to different stakeholders


<br/>
<p>Here is a recap of our trajectory and the course overview:</p>

## Week 6: H2O Model Performance {#week6}

### Performance Overview & Setup

The <i>Performance Overview & Setup</i> module summarizes this week’s course material and reviews the required code, such as extracted `H2O` machine learning models and utility script files.

### H2O Performance For Binary Classification

Learn how to create an `H2O` performance object to retrieve model metrics, such as AUC and logloss. Each `H2O` auto-generated machine learning model can be extracted and saved to memory. 

Once the machine learning models are saved, you will learn how to:

- Compare two competing metrics in binary classification
- Compare top performing models using the AUC metric

<br/>


### Performance Charts For Data Scientists

In <i>Performance Charts For Data Scientists</i>, take your knowledge on how to measure the performance of a single classifier and create a plot that will measure the performance of multiple models.

Performance charting is a great way for data scientists to __evaluate model performance__ using different metrics.

### Performance Charts For Business People

All your efforts to this point have been to create a high-performance model that accurately predicts employee churn. However, business people will not be receptive to the language of data science. 

In this module, learn how to create a chart for business people to understand __how much a model will improve results__. The performance chart for business people will help communicate what can be done to solve the problem and understand how serious the problem is.

<br/>


### Ultimate Model Performance Comparison Dashboard

In this lecture, you will create a model metrics dashboard that combines the performance chart for data scientists and performance chart for business people into one visualization. Combining the charts assist in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of multiple models in one view.
