Data Science and Machine Learning in business begins with R. Why? R is the premier language that enables ___rapid exploration, modeling, and communication___ in a way that no other programming language can match: __SPEED!__ This is why you need to learn R. Time is money, and, in a world where you are measured on productivity and skill, R is your best friend. 

In this ___Data Science With R Series___, we’ll cover what life is like in our ground-breaking, enterprise-grade course called [Data Science For Business With R (DS4B 201-R)](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover/?coupon_code=DS4B15). The objective is to experience the qualities that make R great for business by following a real-world data science project. We review the course that will take you to advanced in __10 weeks__.

We want you to experience what our students are saying is the best online course they have ever taken!

## About The Course

[__Data Science For Business With R (DS4B 201-R)__](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover/?coupon_code=DS4B15) is a one-of-a-kind course designed to teach you the essential aspects for applying data science to a business problem with R. Here’s why it’s unique and why __our students consistently rate it 9 of 10 for satisfaction__:

- The course is based on __real-world experience__ applying data science as a consultant and within organizations

- We provide our __systematic framework__ for solving business problems with data science. This cuts project times in half. [Refer to this testimonial from our student.](https://youtu.be/yw5CtGTzIw0) 

- We focus on the __pursuit of return on investment (ROI) with data science__, the single most important metric that organizations care about. 

- We cover __high performance R packages__ including H2O, LIME, tidyverse, recipes, and more.

## Week 1: Getting Started

Week 1 is designed to get you the necessary knowledge before you jump into coding so you become a ginsu knife able to slice-and-dice problems. As such, week 1 is almost entirely designed to provide you information on the:

- [Business problem](#part1)
- [Tools in our toolbox](#part2) 
- [Frameworks: Systems for success](#part3)
- [Data science project setup](#part4)

The first thing you’ll do is log into the [DS4B 201-R Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover/?coupon_code=DS4B15) through [Business Science University](https://university.business-science.io). The application looks like this.

### Business Problem {#part1}

We’re focused on a __$15 MILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM: EMPLOYEE TURNOVER__. This is a problem that affects thousands of organizations, and it’s extremely costly. Worse, it almost always goes unnoticed because it’s indirect. Employee turnover (attrition) affects productivity, which is not an accounting expense. We teach you:

- What happens when employees leave an organization, and how it affects productivity

- How to calculate the __TRUE COST OF ATTRITION__

- How to use an Excel Calculator to quickly communicate estimated costs to executives

You’ll learn from an expert on the business problem via self-paced lectures.

![Understanding The Business Problem](/assets/2018-09-20-data-science-with-R-1/business_problem.png)

<p class="date text-center">Understanding the Business Problem</p>

You’ll get the Excel Calculator to expose others in your organization to the cost of employee attrition.

Once you fully understand the problem, it’s time to investigate tools that will empower us in our pursuit of data science ROI!

### Tools In Our Toolbox {#part2}

Now it’s time to learn about two groups of amazing tools that we have at our disposal to solve the problem:

- __Integrated Data Science Frameworks__: The Business Science Problem Framework and the CRISP-DM, which are integrated.

- __H2O and LIME__: Machine Learning packages that enable both high performance predictive analytics and high explainability of machine learning models. Perfect for business problems!

![H2O and LIME](/assets/2018-09-20-data-science-with-R-1/h2o_lime.png)

<p class="date text-center">H2O and LIME: Tools In Our Toolbox</p>

Once you get a sense for what tools are coming, it’s now time to learn about the first set of tools - the integrated data science frameworks.

### Frameworks: Systems For Success {#part3}

Frameworks are essential in business. Benefits of having frameworks:

- Instill confidence from management
- Communicate a clear plan 
- Keep everyone on task
- Answer the question: “Why is it impossible to perform a data science project in 1 week?”

You’ll learn about two integrated data science frameworks that are built upon our experience and industry-leading performance: 

1. [CRISP-DM: Cross Industry Standard Procedure for Data Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining)

2. [BSPF: Business Science Problem Framework](https://www.business-science.io/bspf.html)

These two frameworks create the foundation for every step in the subsequent weeks. __We follow the BSPF + CRISP-DM every step of the way as you solve this data science project!__

![Business Science Problem Framework](/assets/2018-09-20-data-science-with-R-1/bspf_computer.png)

<p class="date text-center">Follow The BSPF Process Step-By-Step Throughout The Project</p>

Now that you have a general idea of how the frameworks work, we’re almost ready to get started. The last step is setting up the data science project. 


### Data Science Project Setup {#part4}

We’ll go through the process of setting up your data science project by:

- Creating an R Project in the RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 

- Programmatically creating the directory structure with the `fs` package

- Install the required R Packages (see video sample below)

- Download the data for modeling turnover

Check out the [“Installing Required Packages”](https://youtu.be/UAT3VeILS6g) sample lecture that explains the R packages you’ll be using throughout the course!
