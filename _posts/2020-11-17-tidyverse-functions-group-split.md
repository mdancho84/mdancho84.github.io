This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

Group Split and Map are SECRET TOOLS in my data science arsenal.  Combining them will help us scale up to 15 linear regression summaries to assess relationship strength & combine in a GT table. Here are the links to get set up ðŸ‘‡

<h1>My secret weapon <br><small>Group split is SERIOUSLY POWERFUL.</small></h1>

In fact, I use `group_split()` almost every day.  I use to convert data frames to iterable lists:

- Shiny Apps (making iterable cards)
- Modeling (Regression by Sub-Groups)
- Doing complex group-wise calculations - things you can't do with group_by()

Let's check `group_split()` out. With 3 lines of code, we turn an ordinary data frame into an iterable.

<center>After <br>Now we have a list of data frames (i.e. an iterable)</center>

# Modeling with Broom

**So what can we do with this "iterable"?**

How about detect relationships with a Linear Regression Model using Broom's Glance Function!

And with a little extra work (thanks to _Thomas Mock_ @rstudio & the `gt` R package), we can create this INSANE TABLE! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
