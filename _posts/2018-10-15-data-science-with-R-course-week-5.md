The culmination of the previous weeks has been preparation for machine learning modeling. At this stage, we have defined the business problem, we’ve explored and understood how the data relates to the business problem, and we’ve preprocessed the data in preparation for modeling. 

This week will focus on the following topics:

- Introduction to automated machine learning, predictive modeling with H2O
- Apply automated machine learning to the Attrition problem
- Develop high-performance models and learn how automated machine learning works 
- Develop a visualization of the models to communicate the best and worst performing models


<br/>
<p>Here is a recap of our trajectory and the course overview:</p>

## Week 5: Predictive Modeling With H2O {#week5}

### Modeling Setup

The modeling setup focuses on structuring your project to support new utility functions and extracted models from H2O automated machine learning.

In addition, you will be introduced to the new libraries `cowplot`, `fs` and `glue` - used in evaluating H2O model performance.

<br/>


### H2O Automated Machine Learning

H2O automated machine learning is an exciting part of the course. This module will teach you the following:

- Learn how to use the H2O library to create machine learning models
- Inspect the model leaderboard to select the best performing models
- Extract and save models to your directory structure for exploration
- Make predictions using your models
- Use H2O documentation to continue learning

</p>

<br/>


### Advanced Concepts

Automated machine learning is an effective way to create and compare multiple machine learning models. However, you still need to understand why a model is good or bad and adjust individual model parameters for better performance. 

The advanced concepts will teach you how to modify model parameters, create a stable model using k-fold cross-validation, and an introduction to the grid search algorithm - the process automated machine learning uses to generate models.

</p>

<br/>


### Visualizing The Leaderboard

Leaderboard visualization is a great way to communicate model performance. Learn how to create a function for visual representation of your machine learning models. The visualization can be filtered by model metrics, such as AUC or Logloss (more about AUC and Logloss in week 6).

### Bonus! Grid Search In H2O

The __Grid Search in H2O Bonus__ continues the model performance discussion from Advanced Concepts!  In this module you will learn how to tune a model that was generated from automated machine learning. 

Learn the details of extracting a model, analyzing performance metrics, and more!
