We recently had an awesome opportunity to work with a great client that asked __Business Science__ to build an __open source anomaly detection algorithm__ that suited their needs. The business goal was to accurately detect anomalies for various marketing data consisting of website actions and marketing feedback spanning thousands of time series across multiple customers and web sources. Enter `anomalize`: __a tidy anomaly detection algorithm that's time-based (built on top of `tibbletime`) and scalable from one to many time series__!! We are really excited to present this open source R package for others to benefit. In this post, we'll go through an overview of what `anomalize` does and how it works. 

## Case Study: When Open Source Interests Align

We work with many clients teaching data science and using our expertise to accelerate their business. However, it's rare to have a client's needs and their willingness to let others benefit align with our interests of pushing the boundaries of data science. This was an exception.

Our client had a challenging problem: __detecting anomalies in time series on daily or weekly data at scale__. Anomalies indicate exceptional events, which could be increased web traffic in the marketing domain or a malfunctioning server in the IT domain. Regardless, it's important to flag these unusual occurrences to ensure the business is running smoothly. One of the challenges was that the client deals with not one time series but __thousands that need to be analyzed for these extreme events__.

An opportunity presented itself to develop an open source package that aligned with our interests of building a scalable adaptation of the [Twitter `AnomalyDetection` package](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection) and our client's desire for a package that would benefit from the open source data science community's ability to improve over time. The result is `anomalize`!!!

## 2 Minutes To Anomalize

We've made a short introductory video that's part of our new Business Science Software Intro Series on YouTube. This will get you up and running in under 2 minutes.

For those of us who prefer to read, here's the gist of how `anomalize` works in four simple steps. 

### Step 1: Install Anomalize


{% highlight r %}
install.packages("anomalize")
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 2: Load Tidyverse and Anomalize


{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)
library(anomalize)
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 3: Collect Time Series Data

We've provided a dataset, `tidyverse_cran_downloads`, to get you up and running. The dataset consists of daily download counts of 15 "tidyverse" packages.


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 6,375 x 3
## # Groups:   package [15]
##    date       count package
##    <date>     <dbl> <chr>  
##  1 2017-01-01  873. tidyr  
##  2 2017-01-02 1840. tidyr  
##  3 2017-01-03 2495. tidyr  
##  4 2017-01-04 2906. tidyr  
##  5 2017-01-05 2847. tidyr  
##  6 2017-01-06 2756. tidyr  
##  7 2017-01-07 1439. tidyr  
##  8 2017-01-08 1556. tidyr  
##  9 2017-01-09 3678. tidyr  
## 10 2017-01-10 7086. tidyr  
## # ... with 6,365 more rows
{% endhighlight %}


### Step 4: Anomalize

Use the three tidy functions: `time_decompose()`, `anomalize()`, and `time_recompose()` to detect anomalies. Tack on a fourth, `plot_anomalies()` to visualize.


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    time_decompose(count) %>%
    anomalize(remainder) %>%
    time_recompose() %>%
    plot_anomalies(time_recomposed = TRUE, ncol = 3, alpha_dots = 0.5)
{% endhighlight %}

Well that was easy... but, what did we just do???

## Anomalize Workflow

You just implemented the "anomalize" (anomaly detection) workflow, which consists of:

* Time series decomposition with `time_decompose()`
* Anomaly detection of remainder with `anomalize()`
* Anomaly lower and upper bound transformation with `time_recompose()`

### Time Series Decomposition

The first step is time series decomposition using `time_decompose()`. The "count" column is decomposed into "observed", "season", "trend", and "remainder" columns. The default values for time series decompose are `method = "stl"`, which is just seasonal decomposition using a Loess smoother (refer to `stats::stl()`). The `frequency` and `trend` parameters are automatically set based on the time scale (or periodicity) of the time series using `tibbletime` based function under the hood.


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    time_decompose(count, method = "stl", frequency = "auto", trend = "auto")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 6,375 x 6

## # ... with 6,365 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

A nice aspect is that the `frequency` and `trend` are automatically selected for you. If you want to see what was selected, set `message = TRUE`. Also, you can change the selection by inputting a time-based period such as "1 week" or "2 quarters", which is typically more intuitive that figuring out how many observations fall into a time span. Under the hood, `time_frequency()` and `time_trend()` convert these from time-based periods to numeric values using `tibbletime`!

### Anomaly Detection Of Remainder

The next step is to perform anomaly detection on the decomposed data, specifically the "remainder" column. We did this using `anomalize()`, which produces three new columns: "remainder_l1" (lower limit), "remainder_l2" (upper limit), and "anomaly" (Yes/No Flag). The default method is `method = "iqr"`, which is fast and relatively accurate at detecting anomalies. The `alpha` parameter is by default set to `alpha = 0.05`, but can be adjusted to increase or decrease the height of the anomaly bands, making it more difficult or less difficult for data to be anomalous. The `max_anoms` parameter is by default set to a maximum of `max_anoms = 0.2` for 20% of data that can be anomalous. This is the second parameter that can be adjusted. Finally, `verbose = FALSE` by default which returns a data frame. Try setting `verbose = TRUE` to get an outlier report as a list.


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    time_decompose(count, method = "stl", frequency = "auto", trend = "auto") %>%
    anomalize(remainder, method = "iqr", alpha = 0.05, max_anoms = 0.2)
{% endhighlight %}

## #   anomaly <chr>
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to visualize what's happening, now's a good point to try out another plotting function, `plot_anomaly_decomposition()`. It only works on a single time series so we'll need to select just one to review. The "season" is removing the weekly cyclic seasonality. The trend is smooth, which is desirable to remove the central tendency without overfitting. Finally, the remainder is analyzed for anomalies detecting the most significant outliers. 


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    
    # Select a single time series
    filter(package == "lubridate") %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    
    # Anomalize
    time_decompose(count, method = "stl", frequency = "auto", trend = "auto") %>%
    anomalize(remainder, method = "iqr", alpha = 0.05, max_anoms = 0.2) %>%
    
    # Plot Anomaly Decomposition
    plot_anomaly_decomposition() +
    ggtitle("Lubridate Downloads: Anomaly Decomposition")
{% endhighlight %}

### Anomaly Lower and Upper Bounds

The last step is to create the lower and upper bounds around the "observed" values. This is the work of `time_recompose()`, which recomposes the lower and upper bounds of the anomalies around the observed values. Two new columns were created: "recomposed_l1" (lower limit) and "recomposed_l2" (upper limit).


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    time_decompose(count, method = "stl", frequency = "auto", trend = "auto") %>%
    anomalize(remainder, method = "iqr", alpha = 0.05, max_anoms = 0.2) %>%
    time_recompose()
{% endhighlight %}

## #   anomaly <chr>, recomposed_l1 <dbl>, recomposed_l2 <dbl>
{% endhighlight %}


Let's visualize on just the "lubridate" data. We can do so using `plot_anomalies()` and setting `time_recomposed = TRUE`. This function works on both single and grouped data. 


{% highlight r %}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    # Select single time series
    filter(package == "lubridate") %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    # Anomalize
    time_decompose(count, method = "stl", frequency = "auto", trend = "auto") %>%
    anomalize(remainder, method = "iqr", alpha = 0.05, max_anoms = 0.2) %>%
    time_recompose() %>%
    # Plot Anomaly Decomposition
    plot_anomalies(time_recomposed = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Lubridate Downloads: Anomalies Detected")
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. Once you have the "anomalize workflow" down, you're ready to detect anomalies!

## Packages That Helped In Development

The first thing we did after getting this request was to investigate what methods are currently available. The last thing we wanted to do was solve a problem that's old news. We were aware of three excellent open source tools:

* Twitter's `AnomalyDetection` package: Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection).
* Rob Hyndman's `forecast::tsoutliers()` function available on through the `forecast` package on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=forecast).
* Javier Lopez-de-Lacalle's package, `tsoutliers`, on [CRAN]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tsoutliers).

We have worked with all of these R packages and functions before, and each presented learning opportunities that could be integrated into a scalable workflow.

### Twitter AnomalyDetection

What we liked about Twitter's `AnomalyDetection` was that it used two methods in tandem that work extremely well for time series. The "Twitter" method uses time series decomposition (i.e. `stats::stl()`) but instead of subtracting the Loess trend, it uses the piece-wise median of the data (one or several medians split at specified intervals). The other method that `AnomalyDetection` employs is the use of Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate (GESD) as a way of detecting outliers. GESD is nice because it is resistant to the high leverage points that tend to pull a mean or even median in the direction of the most significant outliers. The package works very well with stationary data or even data with trend. However, the package was not built with a tidy interface making it difficult to scale.  

### Forecast tsoutliers() Function

The `tsoutliers()` function from the `forecast` package is a great way to efficiently collect outliers for cleaning prior to performing forecasts. It uses an outlier detection method based on STL with a 3X inner quartile range around remainder from time series decomposition. It's very fast because there are a maximum of two iterations to determine the outlier bands. However, it's not setup for a tidy workflow. Nor does it allow adjustment of the 3X. Some time series may need more or less depending on the magnitude of the variance of the remainders in relation to the magnitude of the outliers.  

### tsoutliers Package

The `tsoutliers` package works very effectively on a number of traditional forecast time series for detecting anomalies. However, speed was an issue especially when attempting to scale to multiple time series or with minute or second timestamp data. 

## Anomalize: Incorporating The Best Of All

In reviewing the available packages, we learned from them all incorporating the best of each: 

* __Decomposition Methods__: We include two time series decomposition methods: `"stl"` (using traditional seasonal decomposition by Loess) and `"twitter"` (using seasonal decomposition with median spans). 

* __Anomaly Detection Methods__: We include two anomaly detection methods: `"iqr"` (using an approach similar to the 3X IQR of `forecast::tsoutliers()`) and `"gesd"` (using the GESD method employed by Twitter's `AnomalyDetection`).

In addition, we've made some improvements of our own:

* __Anomalize Scales Well__: The workflow is tidy and scales with `dplyr` groups. The functions operate as expected on grouped time series meaning you can __just as easily anomalize 500 time series data sets as a single data set__. 

* __Visuals For Analyzing Anomalies__:
    
    * We include a way to get bands around the "normal" data separating the outliers. People are visual, and bands are really useful in determining how the methods are working or if we need to make adjustments. 

    * We include two plotting functions making it easy to see what's going on during the "anomalize workflow" and providing a way to assess the affect of "adjusting the knobs" that drive `time_decompose()` and `anomalize()`.

* __Time Based__: 

    * The entire workflow works with `tibbletime` data set up with a time-based index. This is good because in our experience almost all time data comes with a date or datetime timestamp that's really important to characteristics of the data. 

    * There's no need to calculate how many observations fall within a frequency span or trend span. We set up `time_decompose()` to handle `frequency` and `trend` using time-based spans such as "1 week" or "2 quarters" (powered by `tibbletime`). 


## Conclusions

We hope that the open source community can benefit from `anomalize`. Our client is very happy with it, and it's exciting to see that we can continue to build in new features and functionality that everyone can enjoy.
