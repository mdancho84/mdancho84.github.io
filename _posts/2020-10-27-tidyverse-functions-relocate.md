This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.


Let's learn how `relocate`, **a new function that speeds up column arrangements**.

# Tidyverse relocate() Tutorial

Today we are covering a new R function available in dplyr 1.0.0

# Select vs Relocate

First, let's compare the 2 column reordering functions: `select()` and `relocate()`

<br>

**Select is like `filter()` but for columns**. We just get the columns that we specify.

<br>

**Relocate is like `arrange()` for columns**. It keeps all of the columns, but provides much more flexibility for reordering. Notice how all of the columns are returned.

<br>

With `relocate()`, we can take advantage of special tidy-selectors including `last_col()` with an offset to provide very specific relocation patterns.
