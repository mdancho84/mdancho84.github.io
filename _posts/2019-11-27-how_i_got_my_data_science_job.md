# Landing A Job At a Top Management Consulting Firm

After struggling to balance with my work for many months, I’ve finally completed the Business Science University DS4B 201-R: Data Science For Business With R, taught by Matt Dancho. 

Unlike other MOOCs, this course showed me how to place data analytics in real business settings. Without this course, I would have never attempted to pay attention to business/financial impacts, generated through my analysis. His instruction turned me a more advanced data scientist and helped me find a new career opportunity. 

I will start to work at one of the most prestigious management consulting firms - Deloitte - in October as a cognitive & analytics consultant. 

I highly recommended Business Science's [4-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/4-course-bundle-machine-learning-and-web-applications-r-track-101-102-201-202a/) if you would like to use R as a professional business person!  It's one complete system to go from beginner to expert in 6-months.

# How Did Masatake Ace the Interview?

> "In a job interview, I was able to draw interviewer’s attention because of my experiences to formulate some insight from analytics for ___driving business___, which I had developed through his course."

Learning from Masatake's success, the magic is connecting analytics to the business. If you can successfully show how business problems can be analyzed to return financial benefit, then you will draw the interviewer's attention. 

# What Has Masatake Been Doing to Freshen His Skills?

In addition to taking the _Business Science University_ curriculum, Masatake has been actively participating in LinkedIn's [#100daysofcode](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/100daysofcode/) - A community driven challenge to code every day for 100 days straight. 

Here's an example where Masatake showcases using `ggplot2` to adjust a business plot.
