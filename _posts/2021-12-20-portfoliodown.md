I'm super excited to introduce `portfoliodown`, a new R package that makes it __painless for data scientists__ to create a polished professional website so they can host their project portfolios, get great job interviews, and launch their data science careers. I'll show of a short demo in this article. 

For those that want to learn more about __launching your career in data science with `R`__, I have a [__FREE 40-minute webinar__](https://learn.business-science.io/free-rtrack-masterclass-signup) on what skills are needed (these are the 10 skills that helped me launch my career in data science).

# What is `portfoliodown`?

`portfoliodown` is the __Data Science Portfolio Website Builder.__ In as little as 15-minutes, you can get a professional website created that is designed to get you a job interview. 

The website is streamlined with a focus on the __two questions Hiring Managers need to know:__ 

1. What have you done? 

2. Can you fill our needs?

In summary,`portfoliodown` takes care of __communicating your value in as few words as possible.__

# Example: Matt's Data Science Portfolio

__Check out an example data science portfolio__ at [https://mattdancho.netlify.app](https://mattdancho.netlify.app){:target='_blank'}. It took me 15-minutes to make this with `portfoliodown`.

# Make Your First Portfolio

Now that you see what `portfoliodown` can make, let's get you up and running with your first portfolio. 

## Install `portfoliodown`

At the moment, `portfoliodown` is only available as a development version. Hopefully, we will launch on CRAN, but until then, you can install from GitHub. 

{% highlight r %}
devtools::install_github("business-science/portfoliodown")
{% endhighlight %}

## Load `portfoliodown`

Next, load `portfoliodown`. This brings in key functions that we'll use like `new_portfolio_site()` and `serve_site()`.

{% highlight r %}
library(portfoliodown)
{% endhighlight %}

## Set up your new site

Run `new_portfolio_site()`, which will create a __Data Science Portfolio Website Template.__  

{% highlight r %}
new_portfolio_site()
{% endhighlight %}

## Serve the Site Locally

Run `serve_site()` to serve the portfolio site. It should look like this. The template is essentially a `blogdown` website without the blog. It's designed to be __streamlined__, which is essential for busy hiring managers be able to quickly investigate your project experience, experience, and technical skills.

## Understanding the Data Science Portfolio Template Files

Here's what happens when you run `new_portfolio_site()`:

1. The function gets a special hugo theme designed for data science portfolios from here: https://github.com/business-science/raditian-free-hugo-theme-data-science

2. The hugo theme files are copied into a new hugo website with a directory structure that looks like this. 

![Data Science Portfolio Template - Directory Structure](/assets/2021-12-20-portfoliodown/portfolio_files.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Portfolio Website Directory Structure</p>

This directory contains the following important folders and files:

- `/data`: contains a copy of the `homepage.yml` file. This file is used to modify your website. 

- `/themes`: Contains a copy of the `raditian-free-hugo-theme-data-science` theme. 

- `config.yaml`: A file that controls general information about the website like Google Analytics, Homepage Section Order, etc. 


We'll need knowledge of these files to move onto customizing the site, next. 

## Customizing the Portfolio Template

Obviously your goal isn't to make a template, so you'll want to __customize your new portfolio website__. We'll step through a basic process here. Most of the content for the website will be modified from the `/data/homepage.yml` file. 

### Section 1: The Website Title

Open the `/data/homepage.yml` file. The first section is called `head`. In this section you can modify the title of the webpage. 


![Modify the Head](/assets/2021-12-20-portfoliodown/section_00_head.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Update the Website Title</p>


### Section 2: The Showcase

Next, update the Showcase Section. 

![Modify the Head](/assets/2021-12-20-portfoliodown/section_01_showcase.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Update the Showcase Section</p>

Modify the key parts:

- `enable`: Can toggle whether or not the section shows. 

- `title`, `subtitle` and `description`

- `image`: The images can be modified by creating a new folder and pointing to new images. 

- `button`: This is the call to action. It's set to create an email via the `URL` parameter. 

- `socialLinks`: You can add/modify/delete social links here. 

### Sections 3 - N

The remaining sections can be modified in the same way. 

## Deployment

Once you've designed your Data Science Project Portfolio, __you're now ready to deploy.__ 

Deployment takes two steps:

1. __Push to Github.__ 

2. __Create a Netlify account__ and connect it to your github repo containing your Data Science Portfolio Website. 

Great! You now have a functioning portfolio website.

## ðŸš€ Launching a Career in Data Science

I'll have detailed training coming soon on how to launch a data science career in 2022: __"Launching a Data Science Career in 30-Days".__ 

- You'll need to take the [__5-Course R-Track Courses__](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series) first to gain the prerequisite knowledge needed. Note that this will take several months to complete, but the R-Track system will set you up for insane performance on the job (and wow everyone in the technical interview). 

- __The Career Module__ will cover what to do to land data science interviews, gain recommendations from me, and get promotion after promotion on the job to accelerate your career.
