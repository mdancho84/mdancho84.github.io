The `ggforce` package is a `ggplot2` extension that adds many exploratory data analysis features. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to make __hull plots for visualizing clusters__ or groups within our data.

# What is a Hull Plot?

__The Hull Plot__ is a visualization that produces a shaded areas around clusters (groups) within our data. It gets the name because of the [Convex Hull shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull). It's a great way to show customer segments, group membership, and clusters on a __Scatter Plot__.

We'll go through a short tutorial to get you up and running with `ggforce` to make a hull plot. 

# Hull plots with `ggforce` [Tutorial]

This tutorial showcases the awesome power of `ggforce` for visualizing distributions. 

## Tutorial Credits

This tutorial wouldn't be possible without the excellent work of Thomas Lin Pedersen, creator of `ggforce`. Check out the [ggforce package here](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/index.html).

## Before we get started, get the R Cheat Sheet

`ggforce` is great for extending ggplot2 with advanced features. But, you'll need to learn `ggplot2` to take full advantage. For these topics, I'll use the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) to refer to `ggplot2` code in my workflow.

### Quick Example:

[Download the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html). Then __Click the "CS" hyperlink__ to "ggplot2".

<a href="https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html"> <img src="/assets/2021-07-27-ggforce-hull-plots/ultimate_r_cheatsheet_ggplot2.jpg" style='max-width:80%;display:block;margin:auto;'>

<br>

Now you're ready to quickly reference the `ggplot2` cheat sheet. This shows you the core plotting functions available in the ggplot library.

Onto the tutorial. 

## Load the Libraries and Data

First, run this code to:

1. __Load Libraries:__ Load `ggforce`, `tidyquant`, and `tidyverse`. 
2. __Import Data:__ We're using the `mpg` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`. 

<img src="/assets/2021-07-27-ggforce-hull-plots/00_libraries.jpg" style='max-width:100%;margin-bottom:5px;'>
<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

Here's the `mpg` dataset. We'll focus on "hwy" (fuel economy in Miles Per Gallon), "displ" (engine displacement volume in liters), and "cyl" (number of engine cylinders).

![MPG Dataset](/assets/2021-07-27-ggforce-hull-plots/00_data.jpg)

## hull plot: Using ggplot

Next, we'll make a hull plot that highlights the Vehicle Fuel Economy (MPG) for Engine Size (Number of Cylinders and Engine Displacement). It helps if you have `ggplot2` visualization experience. If you are interested in learning `ggplot2` in-depth, check out our [R for Business Analysis Course (DS4B 101-R)](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r) that contains over 30-hours of video lessons on learning R for data analysis. 

### Step 1: Make the Base Scatter Plot

The first step is to make the scatter plot using `ggplot2`. We:

1. __Prep the Data:__ Using `mutate()` to add a descriptive Engine Size column that will display the Number of Cylinders. 

2. __Map the columns:__ Using `ggplot()`, we map the displ and hwy column. 

3. __Make the scatter points__: Using `geom_point()`, we add scatter plot points to our base plot. Refer to the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) and ggplot2 "CS" for more geoms.

<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

This produces our base plot, which is a scatter plot of displacement vs highway fuel economy.

<img src="/assets/2021-07-27-ggforce-hull-plots/01_plot_output.jpg" style='max-width:100%;margin-bottom:5px;'>

### Step 2: Add the Hull Plot with `geom_mark_hull()`

Next, we add our hull plot geometry layer using `ggforce::geom_mark_hull()`. This produces the hull plot shaded regions indicating the groups. We map the descriptive engine size column to the `fill` and `label` aesthetics. We adjust the `concavity` to smooth out the concavity. 

<img src="/assets/2021-07-27-ggforce-hull-plots/02_hull_plot_code.jpg" style='max-width:100%;margin-bottom:5px;'>
<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

And here's the output. We can see that the hull plot shows the cylinder class membership for the vehicles scatter points.

### Step 3: Make the plot look professional

It's a good idea to spruce up our plot, especially if we are going to present to business stakeholders in a presentation or report. We'll leverage `tidyquant` and `ggplot` for theme customization. Refer to the [Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html) and `ggplot2` documentation for more customizations.

<img src="/assets/2021-07-27-ggforce-hull-plots/03_ggplot_theme_customization.jpg" style='max-width:100%;margin-bottom:5px;'>
<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

And here's the output. We have our final plot that tells the story of how highway fuel economy varies with the vehicle's number of cylinders and engine displacement volume.

# Summary

We learned how to make hull plots with `ggforce`. __But, there's a lot more to visualization.__ 

It's critical to __learn how to visualize__ with `ggplot2`, which is the premier framework for data visualization in R.

# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn data science. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.  I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

__If you feel like this, you're not alone.__

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. __Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught smartly__

2. __Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.__

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will __get you past your struggles__ and improve your career in the process. 

It's called the [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 5+ projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment. 

The result is that __you break through previous struggles__, learning from my experience & our community of 2000+ data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
