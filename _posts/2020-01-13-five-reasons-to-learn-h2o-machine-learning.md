<h2>Machine Learning<br><small><strong>Up 440%</strong> vs 5-Years Ago</small></h2>

Before I jump into H2O, let's first understand the demand for ML. The 5-year trends in Technology Job Postings show a __440% increase in "Machine Learning" skills__ being requested, capturing a 7% share in all technology-related job postings. 

Not just "Data Scientist" Jobs... __ALL Technology Jobs.__

## My point: Learning ML is essential

We can safely say that if you are in a technology job (or seeking one) then you need to learn how to apply AI and Machine Learning to solve business problems. 

__The problem:__ There are a dozen machine learning and deep learning frameworks - `TensorFlow`, `Scikit-Learn`, `H2O`, `MLR3`, `PyTorch`, ... These all take time and effort to learn. So, which framework should you learn for business?

__Why I use and recommend H2O:__ _H2O has singlehandedly produced results in hours that would have otherwise taken days or weeks._ I recommend learning `H2O` for applying Machine Learning to business data. I've been using H2O for several years now on both consulting projects and teaching it to clients. I have 5 reasons that explain how I have gotten this ___productivity enhancement___ using H2O on my business projects. 

## 5-Reasons why I use and teach H2O

My __Top 5-Reasons__ why I use and recommend learning `H2O`.

<h3>1. AutoML<br><small><strong>Massive Productivity Booster</strong></small></h3>

`H2O AutoML` automates the machine learning workflow, which includes ___automatic training and tuning of many models___. This allows you to spend your time on more important tasks like feature engineering and understanding the problem.

</p>


<h3>2. Scalable on Local Compute<br><small><strong>Distributed, In-Memory Processing speeds up computations</strong></small></h3>

In-memory processing with fast serialization between nodes and clusters to support massive datasets enables problems that traditionally need bigger tools to be solved in-memory on your local computer.


<h3>3. Spark Integration & GPU Support<br><small><strong>Big Data</strong></small></h3>

- <a href="https://spark.rstudio.com/guides/h2o/" target="_blank">H2O’s Spark integration (Sparkling Water)</a> enables distributed processing on Big Data. 
- <a href="https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o4gpu/" target="_blank">H2O4GPU</a> enables running H2O's R and Python libraries using GPUs. 

The result is __100x faster training__ than traditional ML.

<h3>4. Best Algorithms, Optimized and Ensembled<br><small><strong>Superior Performance</strong></small></h3>

H2O’s algorithms are developed from the ground up for distributed computing. The most popular algorithms are incorporated including: 

- XGBoost
- GBM
- GLM
- Random Forest
- and more. 

`AutoML` ___ensembles___ (combines) these models to provide __superior performance.__


<h3>5. Production Ready<br><small><strong>Docker Containers</strong></small></h3>

    <p class="text-center">Learn More: What is Docker?</p>
  </a>
</div>

I love using [Docker (learn why)](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/11/22/docker-for-data-science.html) + `H2O` to integrate `AutoML` models into `Shiny` Web Applications.  H2O is built on (and depends on) Java, which traditionally creates overhead. But, with H2O Docker Images, it makes deploying H2O Models super easy with all necessary software inside the pre-built Docker Image.

## H2O in Production

`H2O` can be integrated into `Shiny` Applications like this one - an _Employee Attrition Prediction & Prevention App_.

</p>

## H2O is the underlying prediction technology

__You need to learn H2O AutoML__ to build the _Employee Attrition Shiny App_. `H2O AutoML` generates the _"Employee Attrition Machine Learning Model"_ that scores the employees based on features like tenure, over time, stock option level, etc.

## The H2O Course

If you are ready to learn `H2O AutoML` along with critical supporting technologies and data science workflow processes that follow an enterprise-grade system, then look no further: [__DS4B 201-R (Advanced Machine Learning & Business Consulting Course)__](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover). 

You follow a 10-week program for solving Business Problems with Data Science that teaches each of the tools needed to solve a __$15M/year employee attrition problem__ using Machine Learning (`H2O`), Explainable ML (`LIME`), and Optimization (`purrr`).
