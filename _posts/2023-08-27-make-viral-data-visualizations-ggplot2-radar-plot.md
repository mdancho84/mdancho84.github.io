# The Art of Persuassion (The "STOP and Pay Attention" Technique)

The problem is you suck at getting people to pay attention to you. I know because I've been there (and spent the last 6 years improving my ability to market myself and my company.) 

At first I had zero followers. An email list of zero. And my company started with zero money its bank account. I had become an above average data scientist, but the bottom line was that I was absolutely terrible at marketing. In fact, my first articles got virtually zero views. They were complete and utter garbage.

Today, Business Science has a 120,000+ email list. And is doing 6-figures every month. And to get this game-changing progress for my company, going viral was essential.

But even if you're not a marketer, **overlooking this critical skill is a *death-sentence* for your Data Science career. This is why:**

# Why NOT Going Viral is a Death-Sentence for YOUR Data Science Career

Virality is the ability to control eyeballs. It's essential in any job role:

1. Whether you are competing for funding for a project at work
2. Or you are competing for eyeballs on LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube, etc

**If you can't control the eyeballs, then you're failing.** Your costing your company money. Your costing your career. Your not making critical connections, and your wasting your time. And that's a problem. 

So how do we fix it?

# A Dead-Simple Framework: "STOP AND PAY ATTENTION" 

The easiest way to control eyeballs is using a *pattern interupt*, simply put a way to get them to stop what they are doing and pay attention to me. **My vehicle for creating pattern interupts is my "Stop and Pay Attention" framework.**:

* "Stop and Pay Attention" is a little framework that I've used to get over 100 articles and posts on LinkedIn and Twitter to go viral. 
* This has created 50,000+ leads, many of which have converted to paying customers. 
* And it's also just as effective in the board room with a bunch of Executives that are near faking an illness to get out of your next presentation. Here's the key components: 

#### 1. THE STOP ACTION: 

I started this R-tips Newsletter article with a pattern interupt (also called a "hook"). The hook is designed to get you to stop scolling and pay attention to what I'm saying. Let's dig into this pattern interupt:

> ***Quit "Storytelling with data".***

What I'm doing is **throwing a stone at a *sacred cow*: "Story Telling"**. A *sacred cow* is a topic that my target audience (data scientists and data analysts) believe is important to their careers. Truth be told, storytelling *is* important. But I also know that most data scientists and data analysts suck at it. **That's my in.** 

#### 2. THE PAY ATTENTION TRANSITION:

The next 2 statements are my "Pay-Attention" transition. 

> ***There's a reason your data visualizations aren't working. Hear me out.***

**Tweek the pain point:** The first sentence is used to tweek your pain. I know that most data scientists' reports get thrown in the trash. Their emails go unread. And there's nothing more depressing than working weeks on a project for an Executive to not even open your email. 

**Listen to me (pay attention)**: I then as you to "hear me out." Give me 30 seconds of your life to explain myself. And now I have you reading this article that I designed for you. 

# 10X Virality with Data Visualizations

It turns out that people process images 1000X faster than they do words. This is the real reason why "Storytelling" is so popular for data scientists and data analysts. Simply put, our Data Visualizations are **OUR FORCE MULTIPLIER**. ðŸ‘‡

![Types of Data Professionals Radar Plot](/assets/067_types_of_data_professionals_radar_plot.png)

<p class="text-center date">Data Visualizations are a FORCE MULTIPLIER</p>


Including a Data Visualization with this newsletter **drives up curiosity and also gives you proof of a promise**, I'm going to help you create [this "Viral Image"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattdancho_its-2023-and-traditional-data-science-is-activity-7072599683017125890-R6IW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), that has been popularized by me and others on the internet. And leaving this training you get something that you want: Skills to create viral data visualizations with R. 

# How to APPLY "Stop AND Pay Attention" to Data Science Projects

You're probably thinking, this "Stop and Pay Attention" stuff sounds great if my goal is to become an LinkedIn rockstar, but how does the "STOP AND PAY ATTENTION" framework **help me convince Executives** to buy into my data science projects?

**The fact is "STOP AND PAY ATTENTION" can be effortlessly adapted to hook Executives. Here's how.** 

Let's take a Customer Churn Project that I want to present my findings on. My audience is non-technical. They are leadership, CEOs, VP's, Directors. But they don't know data science.  

#### Here's my whole Stop AND Pay Attention statement:

> **"Stop Cold-Emailing Customers. Your Customers are Dying. Let me explain."**

#### STOP (The Pattern Interrupt):

> **"Stop Cold-Emailing Customers."**

#### Pay Attention (Tweak pain. And the transition): 

> **"Your Customers are Dying. Let me explain."**

#### Add a Data Visualization (FORCE MULTIPLIER)

If that hook didn't get them, then this visual will. I share how much money they gained last month and lost last month. ([Code is a bonus for this R-tip](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website))

# And that's the STOP AND APPLY framework (but you want the R code, right?)

Alright, I have a quick `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` tutorial so you can create your own VIRAL DATA VISUALIZATIONS. BUT FIRST...

# Tutorial: How to make VIRAL Data Visualizations in R

This tutorial is awesome. You'll learn how I made the [VIRAL "Types of Data Professionals" radar plot](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattdancho_its-2023-and-traditional-data-science-is-activity-7072599683017125890-R6IW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). And through this [free R-tip](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter-register?el=website), you'll improve your ability to make VIRAL data visualizations in R. Let's go. 

## Step 1: Get the Excel File

First, get this Excel file. To do so, [join the R-Tips Newsletter](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website). This gets you access to the code for all of my R-Tips. 

![Excel File](/assets/067_03_excel_file.png)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Excel File.</strong></a> </p>

The Excel file is located in `067_types_of_data_professionals\data\` folder. 

## Step 2: Load the Libraries

First, load these libraries and the dataset. 

![Load the Libraries](/assets/067_01_libraries.png)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the data and code.</strong></a> </p>

Here's what the data looks like when imported from the Excel file:


![Excel Import](/assets/067_04_raw_excel_import.png)

## Step 3: Data Preparation

We need to convert the dataset into long format for the "tidy" data visualization. Run this code:

![Data Preparation Code](/assets/067_02_data_prep.png)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

Here's what the data looks like after preparation:

![After Data Preparation](/assets/067_09_after_data_prep.png)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Excel Data.</strong></a> </p>

## Step 4: Make the Basic Radar Plot

Run this code to make the basic radar plot. 

![Make the Basic Radar Plot in R](/assets/067_05_basic_radar_plot.png)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>


The basic radar `ggplot2` plot output:

![Basic Radar Plot ggplot2](/assets/067_06_basic_radar_plot_ggplot.png)


## Step 5: Dress Up the Radar Plot FOR VIRALITY!

If you want to make VIRAL Plots, then you need to dress them up! Let's customize the plot by running this code:

![Dress Up the Radar Plot in R](/assets/067_07_dress_up_radar_plot.png)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

Here's what the final plot that went viral looks like:
