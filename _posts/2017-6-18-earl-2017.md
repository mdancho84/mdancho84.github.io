The [EARL SF 2017](https://earlconf.com/sanfrancisco/) conference was just held June 5 - 7 in San Francisco, CA. There were some amazing presentations illustrating how R is truly being embraced in enterprises. We gave a __three-part presentation__ on `tidyquant` for financial data science at scale, `timekit` for time series machine learning, and _Business Science_ enterprise applications. We've uploaded the [EARL presentation to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BYjv1AKI1Y). Check out the presentation, and don't forget to [check out our announcements](#announcements) and to [follow us on social media](#social) to stay up on the latest _Business Science_ news, events and information!  

# EARL 2017 Presentation

If you're interested in financial analysis, forecasting, and business applications, check out our 30 minute presentation from EARL SF 2017! The presentation is three-in-one:

1. Financial data science at scale with `tidyquant` (0:45)
2. Time series machine learning with `timekit` (9:10)
3. Enterprise applications with _Business Science_ (23:00)

## Forecasting daily CRAN downloads

One of the big areas of interest on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/870624661616209922) leading up to the presentation was this tweet from Hadley showing growth in daily CRAN downloads are up to 1.25M per day:

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Total daily CRAN downloads for the RStudio mirror for the last 3 years. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash">#rstats</a> <a href="https://t.co/Wo5zz3xZyc">pic.twitter.com/Wo5zz3xZyc</a></p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/870624661616209922">June 2, 2017</a></blockquote>

...and our response showing that it's quite possible to __exceed 2M downloads per day__ by end of the year!

## How we made the CRAN daily download forecast graph

Several in the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=tyah) community wanted to know how [this forecast](https://twitter.com/mdancho84/status/870737108729835521) was made:

![EARL SF 2017 Presentation](/assets/cran-dload-forecast.png)

It turns out that it's actually a combination (or ensemble) of four separate predictions:

1. `prophet` with linear growth
2. `prophet` with logistic growth
3. `timekit` using a linear regression on the time series signature
4. `timekit` using a spline first to track trend and then a linear regression on the augmented data frame including the times series signature and the spline

We first made a log transformation and then calculated the for separate models. The key takeaway is that individually, none of the forecasts was a silver bullet! Each had issues with either the training set or the test set. The `prophet` models tended to detect trend better while the `timekit` models tended to detect pattern better.

However, when combined via a simple average of the models, the ensemble prediction exhibited both low training and test error.

# Announcements <a class="anchor" id="announcements"></a>

* We have completed the new package, `sweep`, which aims at "tidying" up the `forecast` workflow by applying `broom` concepts to the various model functions (`auto.arima()`, `ets()`, etc) and `forecast()` output. It's not on CRAN quite yet, but we are encouraging testing. You can download from github: `devtools::install_github("business-science/sweep")`. Please provide feedback on the [sweep github site](https://github.com/business-science/sweep)!

* We are working on a name change of the `timekit` package. While we love the name, there's also [timekit.io](https://www.timekit.io/) that shares a product by the same name. To make it easier differentiating the software products, we are considering the change to `timekitr`. This transition is expected to take place in July.
