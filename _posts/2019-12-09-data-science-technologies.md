## Top 20 Tech Skills 2014-2019

Indeed, the popular employment-related search engine, released an article [showing changing trends from 2015 to 2019 in "Technology-Related Job Postings"](https://www.hiringlab.org/2019/11/19/todays-top-tech-skills/) examining the __5-Year Change of the most requested technology skills.__

</p>

I'm generally not a big fan of these reports because the technology landscape changes so quickly. But, I was pleasantly surprised at the length of time from the analysis - Indeed looked at ___changes over a 5-year period, which gives a much better sense of the long term trends.___ 

## Why No R, Shiny, Tableau PowerBI, Alteryx?

The skills reported are not "Data Science"-specific (which is why you don't see R, Tableau, PowerBI, Alteryx, on the list). 

However, we can glean insights based on the technologies present...

## Cloud, Machine Learning, Apps Driving Growth

From the technology growth, it's clear that __Businesses need Cloud + ML + Apps.__

## My Takeaway

This assessment has led me to my key technologies for Data Scientists heading into 2020. I focus on key technologies related to __Cloud + ML + Apps.__

## Top 5 Data Science Technologies for Cloud + ML + Apps

That Data Scientists should learn for 2020 and beyond - these are geared towards the __Business Demands: Cloud + ML + Apps.__ In other words, businesses need data-science and machine learning-powered web applications deployed into production via the Cloud. 

<mark><strong>Here's what you need to learn to build ML-Powered Web Applications and deploy in the Cloud.</strong></mark> 

_*Note that __R and Python__ are skills that you should be learning before you jump into these._

5 Key Data Science Technologies for Cloud + Machine Learning + Applications
</p>

### 1. AWS Cloud Services

<div class="pull-right hidden-xs" style="width:30%; margin-left:20px;">
  <a href="https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/11/13/data-science-with-aws.html" target="_blank">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/2019-11-13-data-science-with-aws/amazon-web-services.jpg">
  </a>
</div>

The most popular cloud service provider. EC2 is a staple for apps, running jupyter/rstudio in the cloud, and leveraging cloud resources rather than investing in expensive computers & servers.

### 2. Docker for Web Apps 

<div class="pull-right hidden-xs" style="width:30%; margin-left:20px;">

    <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/2019-11-22-docker/docker.png">
  </a>
</div>

Creating docker environments drastically reduces the risk of software incompatibility in production. DockerHub makes it easy to share your environment with other Data Scientists or DevOps. Further, Docker and DockerHub make it easy to deploy applications into production.

### 3. Git Version Control

<div class="pull-right hidden-xs" style="width:30%; margin-left:20px;">

    <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/2019-12-16-git/git.jpg">
  </a>
</div>

Git and GitHub are staples for reproducible research and web application development. Git tracks past versions and enables software upgrades to be performed on branches. GitHub makes it easy to share your research and/or web applications with other Data Scientists, DevOps, or Data Engineering. Further, Git and GitHub make it easy to deploy changes to apps in production.

### 4. H2O Machine Learning

<div class="pull-right hidden-xs" style="width:30%; margin-left:20px;">
  <a href="https://www.business-science.io/business/2020/01/13/5-reasons-to-learn-h2o-machine-learning.html" target="_blank">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/2020-01-13-h2o/h2o_machine_learning.jpg">
  </a>
</div>

Automated machine learning library available in Python and R. Works well on structured data (format for 95% of business problems). Automation drastically increases productivity in machine learning.

### 5. Shiny Web Apps

A comprehensive web framework designed for data scientists with a rich ecosystem of extension libraries (dubbed the "shinyverse").

__Shiny Resource (Coming Soon):__ Shiny Data Science Web Applications 





## Other Technologies Worth Mentioning

6. __dbplyr for SQL__ - For data scientists that need to create complex SQL queries, but don't have time to deal with messy SQL. dbplyr is a massive productivity booster. It converts R (dplyr) to SQL. Can use it for 95% of SQL queries. 

7. __Bootstrap__ - For data scientists that build apps, Bootstrap is a Front-End web framework that Shiny is built on top of and it powers much of the web (e.g. Twitter's app). Bootstrap makes it easy to control the User Interface (UI) of your application. 

8. __MongoDB__ - For data scientists that build apps, MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is useful for storing complex user information of your application in one table. Much easier than creating a multi-table SQL database. 



## Real Shiny App + AWS + Docker Case Example

In my [Shiny Developer with AWS Course (NEW)](https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/), you use the following application architecture that uses `AWS EC2` to create an `Ubuntu Linux Server` that hosts a `Shiny` App in the cloud called the _Stock Analyzer_.

You use `AWS EC2` to build a server to run your _Stock Analyzer_ application along with several other web apps.

Next, you use a `DockerFile` to containerize the application's software environment.

<br><a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/"><small>From Shiny Developer with AWS Course</small></a></p>

You then deploy your "Stock Analyzer" application so it's accessible anywhere via the `AWS Cloud`.
