**ggplot2... for tables?!** Holy cow üêÆ - when I saw `mmtable2` I couldn't believe my eyes. Someone figured out how to make _creating tables just like creating plots_ with ggplots, using a grammar of graphics... err, I mean tables. 

My initial thought is how VALUABLE you are going to be to your organization when you can **make professional reports** that highlight key insights AND look super professional. I mean, just send a report to a customer with one of these tables in it. Dang! You are getting BONUS POINTS for sure. 

Now, for the record, saying _"ggplot2 for tables"_ is a bold statement. So let's figure out what making professional tables with `mmtable2` looks like in **this 5-minute tutorial.**

* Learn how to make a basic table with `mmtable2`.
* **BONUS:** **Learn how to customize the basic table beyond `mmtable2` defaults** **so you can wow your customers, your boss, and executives in your company.**

# Thank You Developers.

Before we move on, please recognize that `mmtable2` was developed by [Ian Moran](https://twitter.com/ianmoran011). Ian has put a ton of work into the [mmtable2 documentation](https://ianmoran11.github.io/mmtable2/).

AND, I'd be remiss if I didn't also credit [Richard Iannone](https://twitter.com/riannone) who created and manages the [gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/), which mmtable2 leverages heavily. (And yes, I have another tutorial in the works on the amazing `gt` package).

Thank you both for everything you do!

# `mmtable2` Tutorial

Let's get up and running with `mmtable2` so we can make a killer table that impresses your bosses and helps you make reports that get you promoted. 

## Goal for our table

Our goal is to analyze the `mpg` dataset (fuel economy of vehicles by important vehicle attributes like manufacturer, number of cylinders, etc). The table we put to into our report:

* Summarizes the average fuel econmony (City and Highway) 
* By two categories: Car Manufacturer and Number of Engine Cylinders

Our final table structure looks like this:

## Step 1: Load the Libraries and Data

First, run this code to:

1. **Load Libraries:** Load `mmtable2` , `gt`, and `tidyverse`.
2. **Import Data:** We're using the `mpg` dataset that comes with `ggplot2`.

Our data looks like this.

## Step 2: Tidy the Data

Our next step is to use `dplyr` and `tidyr` to get the data into the right format for the table. We'll use **4 important data wrangling operations**:

1. `group_by()`: Groups by our grouping columns: Manufacturer and Number of Engine Cylinders.
2. `summarise()`: We'll calculate the average fuel economy for both City and Highway. We combine with the `across()` function which makes it easy to summarize multiple columns. We use the `mean()` function to calculate the averages by group. 
3. `ungroup()`: Ungrouping is needed to remove any leftover groups. 
4. `pivot_longer()`: Used to convert from a "wide" to a "long" data frame, which stacks the City and Highway average fuel economy on top of each other. If you're familiar with `ggplot2` the "long" format is critical to plotting.

The resulting data (post data wrangle) looks like this.

## Step 3: Make the basic table

With the mpg data summarized and in the long format, we can now use `mmtable2` to make a table, just like we would use `ggplot2` to make a plot. We perform 3 actions:

1. **Setup the `mmtable()`**: This is just like `ggplot()` function in ggplot2. 
2. **Specify the headers locations:** This tells the location for each header needed to organize the table. 
3. **Format the header and table cells:** This adds the lines that help to differentiate groups in our data.

The output of the basic table looks like this. Excellent work so far.

# BONUS: Customize the table with `gt`

The magic of `mmtable2` is that it actually uses another awesome package called `gt`, which is what allows mmtable2 to produce awesome-looking tables. 

**So, if we know how to use `gt`, we can customize our basic table!**

Let's give it a go by adding some gt headers, which give the table a title and subtitle.

**And boom!** Now we have a nice title and subtitle that describe what our report readers will be looking at.

# Recap

We learned how to use the `mmtable2` to not only create basic tables using ggplot2-style grammar of tables, but we showed how to customize the table using the `gt` package. Great work! **But, there's a lot more to becoming a data scientist.**

If you'd like to become a data scientist (and have an awesome career, improve your quality of life, enjoy your job, and all the fun that comes along), then I can help with that.

## Step 1: Watch my Free 40-Minute Webinar

Learning data science on your own is hard. I know because **IT TOOK ME 5-YEARS to feel confident.**

AND, I don't want it to take that long for you.

So, I put together a [**FREE 40-minute webinar (a masterclass)**](https://learn.business-science.io/free-rtrack-masterclass-signup) that provides a roadmap for what worked for me.

Literally 5-years of learning, consolidated into 40-minutes. It's jammed packed with value. I wish I saw this when I was starting... It would have made a huge difference.

## Step 2: Take action

For my action-takers, if you are ready to take your skills to the next level and DON'T want to wait 5-years to learn data science for business, AND you want a career you love that earns you $100,000+ salary (plus bonuses), and you'd like someone to help you do this in UNDER  6-MONTHS or less....

Then I can help with that too. There's a link in the [**FREE 40-minute webinar**](https://learn.business-science.io/free-rtrack-masterclass-signup) for a special price (because you are special!) and taking that action will kickstart your journey with me in your corner.

Get ready. The ride is wild. And the destination is AMAZING!
