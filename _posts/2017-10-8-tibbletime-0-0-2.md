Today we are introducing `tibbletime v0.0.2`, and __we've got a ton of new features in store for you__. We have functions for converting to flexible time periods with the `~period formula~` and making/calculating custom rolling functions with `rollify()` (plus a bunch more new functionality!). We'll take the new functionality for a spin with some weather data (from the `weatherData` package). However, the new tools make `tibbletime` useful in a number of broad applications such as __forecasting, financial analysis, business analysis and more__! We truly view `tibbletime` as the next phase of time series analysis in the `tidyverse`. If you like what we do, please [connect with us on social media](#social) to stay up on the latest [Business Science](#contact) news, events and information! 


## Introduction

![Tibbletime v0.0.2](/assets/tibbletime-0-0-2.png)

We are excited to announce the release of `tibbletime v0.0.2` on CRAN. Loads of new
functionality have been added, including:

* __Generic period support__: Perform time-based calculations by a number
of supported periods using a new `~period formula~`.

* __Creating series__: Use `create_series()` to quickly create a `tbl_time` 
object initialized with a regular time series.

* __Rolling calculations__: Turn any function into a rolling version of itself with
`rollify()`.

* A number of smaller tweaks and helper functions to make life easier.

As we further develop `tibbletime`, it is becoming clearer that the package
is a tool that should be used _in addition_ to the rest of the `tidyverse`.
__The combination of the two makes time series analysis in the tidyverse much easier to do!__

## In this post

Today we will take a look at weather data for New York and San 
Francisco from 2013. It will be an exploratory analysis 
to show off some of the new features in `tibbletime`, but the package
itself has much broader application. As we will see, `tibbletime`'s time-based
functionality can be a valuable data manipulation tool to help with:

* Product and sales forecasting

* Financial analysis with custom rolling functions

* Grouping data into time buckets to analyze change over time, which is great for any part of an organization including sales, marketing, manufacturing, and HR!

### Data and packages

The datasets used are from a neat package called `weatherData`. While `weatherData` has functionality to pull weather data for a number of cities, we will use the built-in datasets. We encourage you to explore the `weatherData` API if you're interested in collecting weather data. 

To get started, load the following packages:

* `tibbletime`: Time-aware tibbles for the tidyverse
* `tidyverse`: Loads packages including `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, and `ggplot`
* `corrr`: Tidy correlations
* `weatherData`: Slick package for getting weather data

Also, load the datasets from `weatherData`, "NewYork2013" and "SFO2013".


{% highlight r %}
# Load libraries
library(tibbletime)  # Make sure you have 0.0.2 from CRAN!
library(tidyverse)
library(corrr)
library(weatherData)

# Load weatherData datasets
NYC <- NewYork2013
SFO <- SFO2013
{% endhighlight %}

### Combine and convert

To tidy up, we first join our data sets together using `bind_rows()`. Passing
a named list of tibbles along with specifying the `.id` argument allows 
`bind_rows()` to create a new `City` reference column for us.


{% highlight r %}
# Tidying up the weather data
weather <- bind_rows(list(NYC = NYC, SFO = SFO), .id = "City") %>%
  as_tibble()
weather
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 19,706 x 3
##     City                Time Temperature
##    <chr>               <chr>       <dbl>
##  1   NYC 2013-01-01 00:51:00        41.0
##  2   NYC 2013-01-01 01:51:00        39.9
##  3   NYC 2013-01-01 02:51:00        41.0
##  4   NYC 2013-01-01 03:51:00        41.0
##  5   NYC 2013-01-01 04:51:00        41.0
##  6   NYC 2013-01-01 05:51:00        39.9
##  7   NYC 2013-01-01 06:51:00        39.9
##  8   NYC 2013-01-01 07:51:00        39.9
##  9   NYC 2013-01-01 08:51:00        39.9
## 10   NYC 2013-01-01 09:51:00        39.9
## # ... with 19,696 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we will convert to `tbl_time` and group by our `City` variable. Note that we know this is a `tbl_time` object by `Index: Time` that gets printed along with the tibble.


{% highlight r %}
# Convert to tbl_time class
weather <- weather %>%
  mutate(Time = as.POSIXct(Time)) %>%
  as_tbl_time(Time) %>%
  group_by(City)

weather
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 19,706 x 3
## # Index:  Time
## # Groups: City [2]
##     City                Time Temperature
##  * <chr>              <dttm>       <dbl>
##  1   NYC 2013-01-01 00:51:00        41.0
##  2   NYC 2013-01-01 01:51:00        39.9
##  3   NYC 2013-01-01 02:51:00        41.0
##  4   NYC 2013-01-01 03:51:00        41.0
##  5   NYC 2013-01-01 04:51:00        41.0
##  6   NYC 2013-01-01 05:51:00        39.9
##  7   NYC 2013-01-01 06:51:00        39.9
##  8   NYC 2013-01-01 07:51:00        39.9
##  9   NYC 2013-01-01 08:51:00        39.9
## 10   NYC 2013-01-01 09:51:00        39.9
## # ... with 19,696 more rows
{% endhighlight %}



### Period conversion

The first new idea to introduce is the `~period formula~`. This tells the `tibbletime` functions how you want to time-group your data. It is specified
as `multiple ~ period`, with examples being `1~d` for "every 1 day," and 
`4~m` for "every 4 months."


{% highlight r %}
# Changing to 1 row every 2 days.
# The minimum date per interval is selected by default
as_period(weather, 2~d)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 366 x 3
## # Index:  Time
## # Groups: City [2]
##     City                Time Temperature
##  * <chr>              <dttm>       <dbl>
##  1   NYC 2013-01-01 00:51:00        41.0
##  2   NYC 2013-01-03 00:51:00        30.0
##  3   NYC 2013-01-05 00:51:00        36.0
##  4   NYC 2013-01-07 00:51:00        42.1
##  5   NYC 2013-01-09 00:51:00        39.2
##  6   NYC 2013-01-11 00:51:00        39.0
##  7   NYC 2013-01-13 00:46:00        42.8
##  8   NYC 2013-01-15 00:51:00        39.0
##  9   NYC 2013-01-17 00:51:00        39.0
## 10   NYC 2013-01-19 00:51:00        30.9
## # ... with 356 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

In our original data, it _looks_ like `weather` is an hourly dataset, with each new
data point coming in on the 51st minute of the hour for NYC and the 56th minute
for SFO. Unfortunately, a number of points don't follow this. Check out the following rows:


{% highlight r %}
# Problem: Some timestamp points don't follow hourly pattern
slice(weather, 12:14)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 6 x 3
## # Index:  Time
## # Groups: City [2]
##    City                Time Temperature
## * <chr>              <dttm>       <dbl>
## 1   NYC 2013-01-01 11:51:00        39.9
## 2   NYC 2013-01-01 12:18:00        37.4
## 3   NYC 2013-01-01 12:51:00        37.9
## 4   SFO 2013-01-01 08:56:00        45.0
## 5   SFO 2013-01-01 09:56:00        46.9
## 6   SFO 2013-01-01 10:56:00        46.0
{% endhighlight %}

What we want is 1 row per hour, and in this case we get two rows for NYC hour 12.
We can use `as_period()` to ensure that we only have 1 row for each hour


{% highlight r %}
# Get 1 row per hour with as_period()
weather <- as_period(weather, 1~h)

slice(weather, 12:14)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 6 x 3
## # Index:  Time
## # Groups: City [2]
##    City                Time Temperature
## * <chr>              <dttm>       <dbl>
## 1   NYC 2013-01-01 11:51:00        39.9
## 2   NYC 2013-01-01 12:18:00        37.4
## 3   NYC 2013-01-01 13:51:00        37.9
## 4   SFO 2013-01-01 11:56:00        48.9
## 5   SFO 2013-01-01 12:56:00        51.1
## 6   SFO 2013-01-01 13:56:00        52.0
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have our data in an hourly format, we probably don't care about
which minute it came in on. We can floor the date column using a helper function,
`time_floor()`. Credit to [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) because this is essentially a convenient
wrapper around `lubridate::floor_date()`. Setting the period to `1~h` floors 
each row to the beginning of the last hour.


{% highlight r %}
# Time floor: Shift timestamps to a time-based floor
weather <- time_floor(weather, 1~h)
weather
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 17,489 x 3
## # Index:  Time
## # Groups: City [2]
##     City                Time Temperature
##  * <chr>              <dttm>       <dbl>
##  1   NYC 2013-01-01 00:00:00        41.0
##  2   NYC 2013-01-01 01:00:00        39.9
##  3   NYC 2013-01-01 02:00:00        41.0
##  4   NYC 2013-01-01 03:00:00        41.0

##  9   NYC 2013-01-01 08:00:00        39.9
## 10   NYC 2013-01-01 09:00:00        39.9
## # ... with 17,479 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

### Visualize the data

Now that we have cleaned up a bit, let's visualize the data.


{% highlight r %}
# Yikes: Hourly is a bit too much data for the chart
ggplot(weather, aes(x = Time, y = Temperature, color = City)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8](/figure/source/2017-10-8-tibbletime-0-0-2/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

Seems like hourly data is a bit overwhelming for this kind of chart. Let's 
convert to daily and try again.


{% highlight r %}
# Convert to daily makes the plot much more readable
weather %>%
  as_period(1~d) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Temperature, color = City)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_minimal()
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](/figure/source/2017-10-8-tibbletime-0-0-2/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

That's better. It looks like NYC has a much wider range of temperatures than
SFO. Both seem to be hotter in summer months.

### Period-based summaries

The `dplyr::summarise()` function is very useful for taking grouped summaries.
`time_summarise()` takes this a step further by allowing you to summarise by
period.

Below we take a look at the average and standard deviation of the temperatures
calculated at monthly and bimonthly intervals.


{% highlight r %}
# Weather average by 1 month (monthly)
weather_avg <- weather %>%
  # Monthly average / sd
  time_summarise(1~m,
          avg = mean(Temperature),
          sd  = sd(Temperature))
weather_avg
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 24 x 4

### A closer look at July

July seemed to be one of the hottest months for NYC, let's take a closer look at it.

To just grab July dates, use `time_filter()`. If you haven't seen this before, a `time formula` is used to specify the dates to filter for. The one-sided formula below expands to include dates between, `2013-07-01 00:00:00 ~ 2013-07-31 23:59:59`.


{% highlight r %}
july <- weather %>%
  time_filter(~2013-7)

july
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 1,486 x 3
## # Index:  Time
## # Groups: City [2]
##     City                Time Temperature
##  * <chr>              <dttm>       <dbl>
##  1   NYC 2013-07-01 00:00:00        73.4
##  2   NYC 2013-07-01 01:00:00        73.9
##  3   NYC 2013-07-01 02:00:00        73.4
##  4   NYC 2013-07-01 03:00:00        73.9
##  5   NYC 2013-07-01 04:00:00        73.9
##  6   NYC 2013-07-01 05:00:00        73.9
##  7   NYC 2013-07-01 06:00:00        75.9
##  8   NYC 2013-07-01 07:00:00        75.9
##  9   NYC 2013-07-01 08:00:00        75.2
## 10   NYC 2013-07-01 09:00:00        77.0
## # ... with 1,476 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

To visualize July's weather, we will make a boxplot of the temperatures.
Specifically, we will slice July into intervals of 2 days, and create a series
of boxplots based on the data inside those intervals. To do this, we will 
use `time_collapse()`, which collapses a column of dates into a column of the same
lenth, but where every row in a time interval shares the same date. You can use this resulting
column for further grouping or labeling operations.


{% highlight r %}
# Every row where the date falls between 
# (2013-07-01 00:00:00, 2013-07-02 23:59:59)
# shares the same date, and so on for the entire series
july_collapsed <- july %>% time_collapse(2~d)
july_collapsed
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A time tibble: 1,486 x 3
## # Index:  Time
## # Groups: City [2]
##     City                Time Temperature

##  7   NYC 2013-07-02 23:00:00        75.9
##  8   NYC 2013-07-02 23:00:00        75.9

## # ... with 1,476 more rows
{% endhighlight %}

Let's visualize to see if we can gain any insights. Wow, San Fran maintained a constant cool average of 60 degrees in the hottest month
of the year!


{% highlight r %}
# Plot Temperature in July
july_collapsed %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(format(Time, '%b-%d'), Time), 
             y = Temperature, color = City)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "", title = "Temperature in July, 2013") +
  theme_minimal()
{% endhighlight %}

### Period and rolling correlations

Finally, we will look at the correlation of temperatures in our two cities in a few different ways.

First, let's look at the overall correlation. The `corrr` package provides a nice way to accomplish this with data frames.


{% highlight r %}
weather %>%
  spread(key = City, value = Temperature) %>%
  select(NYC, SFO) %>%
  corrr::correlate()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

Next, let's look at monthly correlations. The general idea will be
to nest each month into it's own data frame, apply `correlate()` to each 
nested data frame, and then unnest the results. We will use `time_nest()` to easily perform the monthly nesting.


{% highlight r %}
monthly_nest <- weather %>%
  spread(key = City, value = Temperature) %>%
  
  # Nest by month, don't add the original dates to the inner tibbles
  time_nest(1~m, keep_inner_dates = FALSE) 

monthly_nest
{% endhighlight %}

## 12 2013-12-31 23:00:00 <tibble [744 x 2]>
{% endhighlight %}

For each month, calculate the correlation tibble and then `focus()` on the NYC column. Then unnest and floor the results.


{% highlight r %}
monthly_nest %>%
  mutate(monthly_cor = map(data, ~corrr::correlate(.x) %>% 
                               corrr::focus(NYC))
         ) %>%
  unnest(monthly_cor) %>%
  time_floor(1~d)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

It seems that summer and fall months tend to have higher correlation than colder months.

And finally we will calculate the __rolling correlation__ of NYC and SFO temperatures. The "width" of our roll will be monthly, or 360 hours since we are in hourly format.

There are a number of ways to do this, but for this example 
we __introduce `rollify()`, which takes any function that you give it and creates a rolling version of it__. The first argument to `rollify()` is the function that you want to modify, and it is passed to `rollify()` in the same way that you would pass a function to `purrr::map()`. The second argument is the window size. Call the rolling function just as you would call a non-rolling version
of `cor()` from inside `mutate()`.


{% highlight r %}
# Rolling custom functions with rollify()
rolling_cor <- rollify(~cor(.x, .y, use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), 
                       window = 360)

weather_rol_cor <- weather %>%
  spread(key = City, value = Temperature) %>%
  
  # Mutate with a rolling function!
  mutate(rolling_cor = rolling_cor(NYC, SFO))

# Plot it!
ggplot(weather_rol_cor, aes(x = Time, y = rolling_cor)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Rolling correlation", title = "1 month rolling correlation of NYC and SFO temperatures") +
  theme_minimal()
{% endhighlight %}

It looks like the correlation is definitely not stable throughout the year,
so that initial correlation value of `.65` definitely has to be taken 
with a grain of salt!

### Rolling Functions: Pros/Cons and Recommendations

There are a number of ways to do rolling functions, and we recommend based on your needs. If you are interested in:

* __Flexibility__: Use `rollify()`. You can literally turn any function into a "tidy" rolling function. Think everything from rolling statistics to rolling regressions. Whatever you can dream up, it can do. The speed is fast, but not quite as fast as other `Rcpp` based libraries.

* __Performance__: Use the `roll` package, which uses `RcppParallel` as its backend making it the fastest option available. The only downside is flexibility since you cannot create custom rolling functions and are bound to those available.   


### Wrapping up

We've touched on a few of the new features in `tibbletime v0.0.2`. Notably:

* `rollify()` for rolling functions

* `as_period()` with generic periods

* `time_collapse()` for collapsing date columns

A full change log can be found in the NEWS file on Github or CRAN.

We are always open to new ideas and encourage you to submit an issue on our 
Github repo [here](https://github.com/business-science/tibbletime).

Have fun with `tibbletime`!



## Final thoughts

Mind you this is only v0.0.2. We have a lot of work to do, but we couldn't
wait any longer to share this. Feel free to kick the tires on `tibbletime`, and let us know your thoughts. Please submit any comments, issues or bug reports to us on GitHub [here](https://github.com/business-science/tibbletime). Enjoy!
