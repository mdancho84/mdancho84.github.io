## Businesses need applications to run

My prognostication for 2020 and beyond is simple - __Businesses need apps to run.__

As business demands for apps has accelerated, this shift has driven [a massive increase in demand in technologies for deploying applications](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/12/09/data-science-technologies.html). According to _Indeed's Hiring Lab_, the 5-year demand for app and cloud technologies has skyrocketed:

- [__AWS Cloud__ - 14% Share, 400% Growth](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/11/13/data-science-with-aws.html)
- [__Docker__ - 4000% Growth](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/11/22/docker-for-data-science.html)
- [__Git Version Control__ - 8% Share, 150% Growth](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/12/09/git-for-apps.html)

This growing technology demand is proof that businesses need apps in a bad way. Learn how to deploy applications, and your __career will accelerate.__ Not to mention the massive benefit to your organization. 

## Problem: No one teaches Data Scientists how to deploy apps

Traditionally, production tasks were performed by _Developer Operations (DevOps)_. The problem with this approach is that 99% of applications are low-to-moderate usage. __Involving DevOps in deploying low-usage data science apps takes them away from deploying and maintaining critical applications (super-high usage, customer-facing, mission-critical).__ Further, it slows down your organizations productivity - getting new apps out becomes a _bottleneck_.

Production - Deployment Becomes the Bottleneck
</p>

__The problem is that no one teaches Data Scientists how to deploy applications.__ Data Scientists become stuck at the ___Last Mile___ - The series of tasks related to getting your app from your computer to the cloud or your organizations server. 

__In 2020 and beyond, Data Scienctists need to meet the accelerating demands of the business__ This is a new challenge. To meet accelerating demands of the business, these _“Last Mile”_ tasks are ones that __Data Scientists can do and must learn how to do__ to _fast-track_ the organization’s ability to produce, deliver, and use data-driven applications with low-to-moderate usage (99% of business apps).


## Solution: Shiny Production with AWS Book and Course

The goal of the [__Shiny Production with AWS Book__](https://business-science.github.io/shiny-production-with-aws-book/) is to detail the ___“Last Mile”___ - A set of tasks required to deploy Full-Stack `Shiny` Applications into Production.

<h2>The Book Does Not Teach Development<br><small>See the Shiny Developer with AWS Course for Develoment and Deployment</small></h2>

I do not teach _`shiny` development_ in this book. Only _application deployment_. To fully replicate the materials in the book, you will need to take the [__Shiny Developer with AWS Course__](https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/) to develop:

1. The __Full Stack Stock Analyzer__ application with `Shiny`, `Bootstrap`, and `MongoDB`, and
2. The __Application Library__ containing full-text search and app tagging capabilities.

__My recommendation:__ 

[Take the Shiny Developer with AWS Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/) if you need to learn every detail of becoming a `Shiny` Developer with `AWS`. Or better yet, take the [__NEW 4-Course R-Track System__](https://university.business-science.io/p/4-course-bundle-machine-learning-and-web-applications-r-track-101-102-201-202a/?coupon_code=DS4B15) to go from beginner to expert in 6-months or less. 

#### Stock Analyzer Application

A full-stack web application that uses `MongoDB` for storing and managing user data (roles, passwords, and settings). The application enables users to store information on their favorites stocks using the `tidyquant` API. The application is built with `Shiny` and hosted on EC2.

## Where the book picks up

This book covers that last mile: __Production.__ You will learn proven strategies for deploying enterprise `shiny` applications. This guide follows the ___"Part 4 - Production with AWS"___ portion of my [Shiny Developer with AWS Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/expert-shiny-developer-with-aws-course-ds4b-202a-r/).

## Learn Shiny App Development and Deployment

If you are ready to learn how to develop and deploy `Shiny` Applications in the cloud using `AWS`, then I recommend my [__NEW 4-Course R-Track System__](https://university.business-science.io/p/4-course-bundle-machine-learning-and-web-applications-r-track-101-102-201-202a/?coupon_code=DS4B15). This system of premium courses is designed to take you __from beginner to expert within 6-months.__
