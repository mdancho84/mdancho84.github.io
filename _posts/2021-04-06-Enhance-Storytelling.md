Boost your story-telling with `Rmarkdown` &amp; `Xaringan`


<h1>Get started with Xaringan Presentations</h1>

<p>The easiest way is to take 10-minutes and <a href="https://youtu.be/5ZeA-E-XIE0"> watch the YouTube video</a>. Here are quick parts that you'll especially enjoy. </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Rmarkdown Capabilities</strong> - Why Interactive Slides are Powerful</li>
    <li><strong>Adding Interactive Maps</strong> - <code>Leaflet</code></li>

<h1>Tip - Infinite Moon Reader (Very Useful)</h1>

<p>The most important part is to set up the Moon Reader (Code & Moon Reader Setup). This RStudio Addin helps you load presentation changes on the fly, which enhances your productivity when making edits by <strong>automatically updating the Xaringan slides.</strong> </p>

<h1>Make Slides</h1>

<p><strong>Slides are made with Rmarkdown code</strong>. By examining the code structure, we can see how markdown gets converted into a slide.</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<h1>Add Interactive Plots and Maps</h1>

<p>The best part of markdown is the ability to add interactivity to HTML documents. <strong>With Xaringan, we can add this interactivity to HTML Slide Decks</strong>. We can add:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Interactive Maps</li>
    <li>Interactive Time Series Plots</li>
    <li>Interactive Data Tables</li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning Rmarkdown</h1>

<p>To make powerful reports and slide-decks that tell your story, you'll need to learn <code>rmarkdown</code>. <strong>Here are a few learning tips.</strong></p>


<h2>Pro Tip 1 - Use the Cheat Sheet</h2>

<p>Making interactive PowerPoint-Style slide decks with Rmarkdown is super simple if you know Rmarkdown. Rmarkdown is an 80/20 tool shown on the first page of my <a href="https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html">Ultimate R Cheat Sheet</a>. When you download the cheatsheet, you get access to the entire ecosystem of R packages.</p>

<p><strong>Click the "CS" next to Rmarkdown.</strong></p>

<h2>PRO TIP 2 - Learn Rmarkdown in my Business Analysis with R Course</h2>

<p>It might be difficult to learn Rmarkdown on your own. I have a course that walks you through the entire process from analysis to reporting.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r"> R for Business Analysis 101 Course</a> is the first course in my <a href="https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/"> R-Track program</a>. You'll make a two reports:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Customer Segmentation Report</li>
    <li>Product Pricing Estimation and Gap Analysis</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the <strong>Customer Segmentation Report.</strong></p>
