This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

<br/>

The `across()` function was just released in _dplyr 1.0.0_. It's a new tidyverse function that extends `group_by` and `summarize` for multiple column and function summaries. 

Learn how to use `across()` to summarize data like a data wizard:

# Why Across?

Across doesn't do anything you can't with normal `group_by()` and `summarize()`. So why `across()`? Simply put, `across()` **allows you to scale up your summarization to multiple columns and multiple functions**. 

Across makes it easy to apply a mean and standard deviation to one or more columns. We just slect the columns and functions that we want to apply.

**That was ridiculously easy.** Keep it up & you'll become a `tidyverse` rockstar.
