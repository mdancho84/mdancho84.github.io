The coronavirus (COVID-19) is changing our living and working lives. Social distancing is the new norm for many, and each country is dealing with this situation differently. __But, we are all in this together and we will get through this together.__ 

I want you to know that during this challenging time, [Business Science is offering free educational resources](#) as a response to the coronavirus outbreak and social distancing measures. __These are free courses and resources to help you _learn R safely from your home_ while simultaneously reducing the _financial burden_ of those being affected.__

I've opened [___Jumpstart with R___](https://university.business-science.io/p/jumpstart-with-r) to help you make your first steps learning Data Science For Business. Jumpstart will be open until Sunday evening to help manage the demand. Each offering gets 1000+ students, which is why I need to throttle to manage forum support. 

I will offer more openings as well, but I encourage you to join with this cohort.

As of this week, I have a brand new Newsletter called [___R-Tips Weekly___](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter). With the speed that R is changing and improving, you need this to stay ahead of the curve.

R-Tips and Learning Labs will really help you stay ahead of the curve as R continues its rapidly changing ecosystem of packages. There are over 15,000 publicly available R packages. You learn the most useful ones with techniques that get results.
