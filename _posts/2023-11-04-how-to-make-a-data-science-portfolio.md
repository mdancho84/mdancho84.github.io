# The Problem: Why You Need a Portfolio?

Whether you're a data scientist, data analyst, or data engineer, you need a portfolio. And you need it now. This is why.

**The core idea is that companies aren't willing to take a risk on a new hire without demonstrating your value. They want to know that you can do the job. And if you don't have a portfolio or professional website, it's costing you the most important aspect in demonstrating your value. Your work.**

So what do you need to demonstrate? Companies are looking for data scientists that can do the following:

1. Demonstrate value with data science projects
2. Communicate results to non-technical audiences
3. Build production web applications
4. Work with a team
5. Learn new skills quickly

This is exactly what you can do with a data science portfolio! Here's how.

# Example: Here's my portfolio that I made in under 15 minutes using `portfoliodown`.

[Here's my portfolio.](https://mattdancho.netlify.app/) I made it in under 15 minutes using `portfoliodown`. **But first, let me explain why I made it and what it does for you.**

![Data Science Portfolio](/assets/072_01_example_portfolio.gif)

<p class="date text-center">My Portfolio</p>

## Why I Made My Portfolio (and Why You Need One)

I made my portfolio because I was getting a lot of requests from people asking me to help them showcase their data science projects. I was getting requests from:

* **My Data Science Students:** That wanted to share their work
* **My Consulting Students:** that wanted to share their consulting projects
* **Fortune 500 Companies:** That wanted to see what my students could do and assess if they were the right fit for their team

I needed a way to help my students and clients showcase their work. I needed a way to help them get hired. I needed a way to help them get promoted. I needed a way to help them get more clients. I needed a way to help them get more business.

So I created `portfoliodown` to help them. And I'm sharing it with you today. When you use `portfoliodown`, it sets you up with a polished portfolio that you can use to showcase your work. It's a great way to get hired, get promoted, and get more business.

Here's the structure of a `portfoliodown` portfolio.  

## `portfoliodown` Portfolio Structure

[Here's the structure of my `portfoliodown` portfolio.](https://mattdancho.netlify.app/) It's a simple website that has the following sections:

1. **Home Page (Showcase):** A brief introduction to me and my work
2. **About Section:** A brief bio
3. **Portfolio Projects:** A list of my data science projects
4. **Experience:** What I've done in my career
5. **Education:** Where I went to school
6. **Testimonials:** What people say about me
7. **Contact:** How to get in touch with me

**Pro-Tip:** As you go through this section, start thinking of what images and dialog you want to fill in your sections. This will help you get your portfolio up and running quickly.

## 1. Home Page (Showcase)

This my homepage and showcase. The showcase introduces me, and gives a high-level what I do. It also has a link to contact me. 

**IMPORTANT:** The *contact me* is super-important. This is the **call to action** for recruiters and hiring managers. It's how they get in touch with you. Not including this is a big mistake. Make it obvious on how to get in touch.

![Data Science Portfolio](/assets/072_02_home_page.jpg)

## 2. About Me Section

This is my about me section. It's a brief bio that explains who I am and what I do. It also has a link to my LinkedIn so they can learn more about me. In the age of bots, this is a great way to show that you are a real person. 

**Pro-Tip:** Use a professional photo, but feel free to add a little personality to your description. 

![Data Science Portfolio](/assets/072_03_about_me.jpg)

## 3. Portfolio Projects Section

This is my portfolio projects section. It's a list of my data science projects. Each project has a title, description, and image. It also has a link to the project.

**Pro-Tip:** **Do NOT share code here. Share Web Applications instead.** Companies can and will steal your code. But they can't steal your web application. This is why I recommend sharing web applications to drive demand. I recommend using `shiny` to build your web applications in R. It's the best way to demonstrate your skills and drive demand for you.  If you are looking to boost your R shiny, time series, and data science skills while building portfolio projects, then I recommend taking my [5-Course R-Track Data Science System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series?el=website) to get up to speed quickly and build your portfolio projects with R Shiny.

![Data Science Portfolio](/assets/072_04_portfolio_projects.jpg)

## 4. Experience Section

This is my experience section. It's a curated list of my relevant work experience. It also has a link to my LinkedIn and Resume. Hiring managers and recruiters need quick access to make sure that you check their boxes. This is why I recommend linking to your LinkedIn and Resume here.

**Pro-Tip** If you don't have a relevant experience, then you can list data science projects you've worked on in courses here. Again, make sure to use apps that you've built and how they can help a company.  If you are looking to boost your relevant data science experience and build portfolio projects, then I recommend taking my [5-Course R-Track Data Science System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series?el=website) to get up to speed quickly and build your portfolio projects with R Shiny.

![Data Science Experience](/assets/072_05_experience.jpg)

## 5. Education Section

This is my education section. It's a list of my education. Hiring managers and recruiters need quick access to your relevant education history. 

**Pro-Tip** If you don't have a relevant education history, then you can list courses and certifications here. This is a great way to show that you are a life-long learner and you're building the skills that companies actually need. If you are looking to boost your relevant data science skills and build portfolio projects, then I recommend taking my [5-Course R-Track Data Science System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series?el=website) to get up to speed quickly and build your portfolio projects with R Shiny.

![Data Science Education](/assets/072_06_education.jpg)

## 6. Testimonials Section

This is my testimonials section. It's a list of what people say about me. In the age of Amazon and 5-Star Ratings, it's important to have testimonials. It's a great way to build trust and credibility. 

**Pro-Tip:** Including Testimonials is also a great way to show that you are a team player.

![Data Science Testimonials](/assets/072_07_testimonials.jpg)

## 7. Contact Me Section

This is my contact me section. It's a list of how to get in touch with me. It has my email.

**Pro-Tip:** Make sure to include this section at the bottom of your data science portfolio website. This is the **call to action** for recruiters and hiring managers. It's how they get in touch with you. Not including this is a big mistake. Make it obvious on how to get in touch.

# 7-Step Process: Howto make a Data Science Portfolio in under 15 minutes (with `portfoliodown`)

Alright, so you know have a good idea of what a professional data science portfolio looks like. Now, let's get you set up with your own portfolio.

## Before you start:

- Make sure to have a professional photo ready. You'll need this for the about me section.
- Make sure to collect images and dialog for each section. This will help you get your portfolio up and running quickly.
- Make sure to have a LinkedIn profile and Resume ready. You'll need these for the experience and education sections.
- Make sure to have a list of data science projects ready. You'll need these for the portfolio projects section.

**Don't have data science projects yet? No problem.** I recommend taking my [5-Course R-Track Data Science System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series?el=website) to get up to speed quickly and build your portfolio projects with R Shiny.

## Step 1: Install `portfoliodown`

Make sure you install from github. This package is not available on CRAN.

![Library](/assets/072_09_install_portfoliodown.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

## Step 2: Create a New Portfoliodown Site

Use the `new_portfolio_site()` function to create a new portfolio site. This will create a new folder with the name you specify.

**Pro-Tip:** You can point the directory to create the site in a folder. I created this site in the R-Tips Newsletter folder `/072_data_science_portfolio_website`. [Get the Example Site and Code Here.](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website)

![New Portfolio Site](/assets/072_10_new_portfolio_site.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

This adds a new folder to your working directory. This is where your portfolio site will be created.

![Portfolio Site Files](/assets/072_11_portfolio_files.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

## Step 3: Serve Your Site

Alright, now for the moment of truth, let's see if your site works. Use the `serve_site()` function to serve your site. This will open a new browser window with your site.

![Serve Site](/assets/072_12_serve_site.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

You should see your site in the browser. It should look like this.

![Portfolio Site](/assets/072_13_portfolio_site.jpg)

## Step 4: Edit Your Site

Editing the site is easy. You just need to edit the `data\homepage.yml` file. This is where you'll add your images and dialog.

Here's what the `data\homepage.yml` file looks like. You can see that I've added my image and dialog.

![Edit Site](/assets/072_14_edit_site.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

Here's what the `data\homepage.yml` file looks like. You can see that I've added my image and dialog.

## Step 5: Edit Your Site Images

To add custom images, add them to the `static\img` folder. It may not be created by default. You can create it.

Here I created a new folder called `static\img\showcase` and added my images (`logo-business-science.png`).

![Edit Site Images](/assets/072_15_edit_site_images.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

Then I updated the `data\homepage.yml` file to point to the new image.

![Edit Site Images](/assets/072_16_edit_site_images.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

You might need to stop the server and restart the site to get the images to refresh. 

![Edit Site Images](/assets/072_17_edit_site_images.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

## Step 6: Edit Your Portfolio Projects

To add portfolio projects, edit the `data\homepage.yml` file's `work` section. This is where you'll add your portfolio projects.

![Edit Portfolio Projects](/assets/072_18_edit_portfolio_projects.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Get the Example Site and Code Here</a></p>

This will allow you to update your portfolio projects. Here's what mine look like:

![Edit Portfolio Projects](/assets/072_19_edit_portfolio_projects.jpg)

**Don't have data science projects yet?** No problem. I recommend taking my [5-Course R-Track Data Science System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series?el=website) to get up to speed quickly and build your portfolio projects with R Shiny.

## Step 7: Publish to Netlify

Deployment is recommended in two steps:

1. **Push your website to Github:** Use `usethis::use_github()` to push the repository from your local machine to the remote GitHub site.

2. **Connect Netlify to GitHub & Publish:** [Netlify has options for free hosting of websites.](https://www.netlify.com/) Simply create an account. Then connect Netlify to GitHub. Select the GitHub repo containing your website. Then deploy.
