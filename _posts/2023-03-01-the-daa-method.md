<h3 class="text-center">
If I wanted to handcuff a business and drive it into the ground- you know what I would do? 
</h3> 


I would take all of the people that are out-of-touch, aren’t-in-the-field, and don’t really know what’s going on in the business…

**… and put them in charge of the company.** 

You may know these people as the C-Suite. 

I call them the **“Success-Prevention Committee.”**

Decisions by committee are slow, tumultuous, inefficient, and compromised. 


This often results in problems like… massive layoffs, missed deadlines, bad quarters, and stock prices dropping. 


That’s right. When a stock drops, you can thank the C-Suite. And what’s worse is, the C-Suite will blame their failures on “the economy” and begin firing people. 


<h3 class="text-center">
“Matt, Are You Telling Me Every Successful Fortune 1000 Company In The World Is Running Their Business Wrong?”
</h3>

**Absolutely.** 


However, the good news is, the C-suite is YOUR ticket to getting promotions, raises, and new positions. 


Better yet, they have one fatal “override” button: **they’re paid bonuses based on the company’s profits.**

So guess what happens if you increase revenue? You increase their bonuses. And what happens when they know YOU’RE the one giving them a bigger paycheck? 


Well, they’ll want you to work even more. To show their gratitude, they’ll give you a better title, unlock access to more resources, and usually hand you more money. 


Think about it, if you can convince the C-Suite to implement your ideas on a grand scale… they look good in front of shareholders… their bonuses go up… 

<h3 class="text-center">
<em>
And YOU Get A Raise.
</em>
</h3>

Oh, what’s that? You don’t know how to get ahold of the C-Suite’s attention? 


That’s fine because I solved that problem 10 years ago with what I’m going to teach you today. 


A long time ago, (back when I dreamed of having a “great corporate job”) I was working at a company called **Bonney Forge.** My title was something like “Sale Engineering Manager”... but I was acting as a **business analyst.**


My job was to find business insights, save money, and generate more revenue. 

And I did just that.


Every month or so, I would work with my team to find AMAZING business insights, put together a report, march into my boss’s office (the V.P. of Sales), and slam it on her desk. (And of course, I was confident she would love it.) 


Being the naive, doe-eyed employee I was… I expected her to read it, be blown away immediately, and call the higher-ups & executives into a meeting about what my team had found.


In fact, every time we had a meeting, I would go on and on about my findings. I’d give speeches. I’d explain the problems I’m solving. I’d show her the benefits.


I’d tell her we need to shift our focus to this new way of making money and tell her how amazing my new “idea” is. 


And you know what I would get in return? 


*“That sounds great Matt! We’ll get right on it.”* and then crickets. 

Week after week, month after month, I did this little dance. I found ways to save money, she put the report in a drawer. 


I’m working 50-60 hours a week creating reports, doing analysis…

<h3 class="text-center">
<em>
… all for my boss to take credit and do nothing with it.
</em>
</h3>

So I got smart. I created a solution called: **D.A.A.**

**It’s one of the building blocks I used to go from an unofficial Business Analyst to the Director of Sales & Marketing at Bonney Forge.**

The best part? Anyone can use this to become a rockstar data scientist. 


Let me show you how.

So before we dive into the DAA, there’s something you should know. First, there are only 3 ways a business drives revenue:  


1. Acquiring New Customers
2. Ascending Existing Customers
3. Repeat Customers

#### Acquiring new customers...

...Means someone new bought something. (Think of when you buy a new book or course. That Author just acquired you as a customer.)

#### Ascending an existing customer... 

...Means you’re getting an old customer to spend more money with you. (usually with more expensive purchases.) (If an Author gets you to read the book and then come to a paid seminar, they’ve ascended you.)

#### Repeat customers... 

...Means you have someone on subscription. (Think of Netflix or Hulu.)


<h3 class="text-center">
So <em>most</em> businesses have some form of a “list”.
</h3>

That’s a list of people who have either:

1. Signed up for a newsletter
2. Bought something
3. Told the business they might be interested in buying something

Before email was around, people had customer lists in the form of OLD SCHOOL spreadsheets typed out by hand on typewriters.


These spreadsheets had their names, phone numbers, addresses, and a record of what that customer has purchased. 


Now that we’re in the digital age, most companies transformed these systems into databases. (*hint* *hint* *wink* *wink* YOU should have access to these databases for analysis.)

For my company Business Science, I have a list of ~100,000 people. You would think that means I have 100,000 people ready to buy but that’s not quite the case. 


Because…

<h3 class="text-center">
Different People Are Interested In Different Things
</h3>

If someone is brand new to data science, they’re going to buy beginner courses.


If someone has been a data scientist for 10 years, they’re going to buy advanced courses. 


If someone is brand new to my list, they may not buy ANYTHING for months. And if they get annoyed with my emails, they’ll unsubscribe. 


Because of these problems, you have to segment your company’s list based on customer information. 

**The easiest way to make more money is to match the right customer to the right products, also known as “customer segmentation”.**

What’s great about customer segmentation and databases is we can use data science. 

<h3 class="text-center">
So in early 2021, I made a Customer Segmentation model to determine which customers I should send sales emails to.
</h3>

At first, I sent sales emails to everyone and I noticed people were unsubscribing in droves. (Not good.)


When they unsubscribe, I can’t send them any more offers and revenue goes down.


Which means I was doing the OPPOSITE of acquiring new customers, I was driving them away, and driving down revenue.

**On the other hand**, not sending emails to the **“ready-to-buy” customers** resulted in a cost of about $2,000 per missed customer.


**The question was, could I optimize this process to grow the business?**

Well, I solved this business problem using the DAA formula.

<h3 class="text-center">
TIME FOR DATA SCIENCE
</h3>

There’s a dead-simple formula that I’ve used to make my company $3,000,000+ in revenue through business process automation.

It’s called the **DAA Formula**, and it stands for:

* Define
* Analyze
* Automate


Here’s how I used it to automate a business process that contributed to a $3,000,000+ revenue stream for my business, Business Science.

And, I made *THIS* business automation in just 30 days.

<h3 class="text-center">
HOW DID <em>THIS</em> HAPPEN?
</h3>

I saw my unsubscribe rates for new subscribers were very high when exposed to a “sales email”.


I validated this by splitting the database up into groups - subscribed less than 30 days vs greater than 30 days.


Unsubscribe rates shot up in the “less than 30 days” group BUT I still got some sales from both groups.


So I couldn’t ignore the findings - **Nurture vs Ready-to-Buy was a thing.** 

And then I came up with an idea. I put it on paper by defining the process to apply data science to this business problem. 


### Step 1: DEFINE the ideal Business Process


The first step was defining the ideal business process in terms of inputs, process steps, and outputs. This is what you *think* you need to solve the problem.

The process I came up with looks like this (for my particular “email unsubscription” problem).

### Step 1A. Inputs (Data you think you need)

The inputs to the ideal process were CSV files that came from 2 databases, namely a MailChimp Email Database and a Teachable Transactions Database.

These datasets gave me:

1. **Transaction history** (I needed this to label who was a buyer)

2. **Descriptive customer data** (The email database contained behavioral data on what the customer was doing e.g. interest tags, webinars attended, email open rates, etc).

### Step 1B. Process Steps (What you think you have to do)

Next, I planned out the process. Here are the exact steps I took... **[SUBSCRIBE TO CONTINUE](https://university.business-science.io/p/the-business-scientist-newsletter)**
