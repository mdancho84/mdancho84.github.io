This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

<br/>

Missing values used to drive me nuts... until I learned how to impute them! In 10-minutes, learn how to visualize and impute in R using ggplot dplyr and 3 more packages to simple imputation. 

Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡

## Handling missing values

We're going to kick the tires on 3 key packages:

- `visdat` - For quickly visualizing data
- `naniar` - For working with NA's (missing data)
- `simputation` - For simple imputation (converting missing data to values)

So let's get started!



<h2>Visualizing Missing Data<br><small>Using vis_miss(), gg_miss_upset() and geom_miss_point()</small></h2>
 

#### Quickly Skim Missing Data 

It doesn't get any easier than this. Simply use `visdat::vis_miss()` to visualize the missing data. We can see Ozone and Solar.R are the offenders.

#### Identify Interactions in Column Missingness

**Use Case**: It often makes sense to **evaluate the interactions between columns containing missing data**. We can use an "upset" plot for this. 

<br>

**Start with a good question:**

_"Is it often that we have both Ozone and Solar.R missing at the same time?"_

We can answer this with `gg_miss_upset()`. We can see that 2 of 5 Solar.R (40%) happen at the same observation that Ozone is missing. Might want to check for IOT sensor issues!

#### Visualize Missing Observations in a Scatter Plot

**Use Case:** This is a great before/after visual. 

For our final exploratory plot, let's plot the missing data using `geom_miss_point()`. It works just like geom_point(), but **plots where the missing data are located in addition to the non-missing data**.

<h2>Imputation<br><small>impute_rf()</small></h2>
   
The simputation library comes with a host of _impute_*()_ functions. We'll focus on `impute_rf()`, which implements a **random forest to do the imputation**.

**This imputes the NA's, replacing the missing Ozone and Solar.R data**. We can see the missing data follows the distribution of the non-missing data in the updated scatter plot.
