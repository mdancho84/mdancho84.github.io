# Read 15 CSV Files [Tutorial]

This FREE tutorial showcases the awesome power of `python` for reading CSV files. We'll read __15 CSV files__ in this tutorial.

Onto the tutorial. 



## Project Setup



First, load the libraries. We'll import `pandas` and `glob`. 

- `Pandas`: The main data wrangling library in Python

- `glob`: A library for locating file paths using text searching (regular expressions)

Second, use `glob` to extract a list of the file paths for each of the 15 CSV files we need to read in.

## Method 1: For-Loop

The most common way to repetitively read files is with a for-loop. It's a great way for beginners but it's not the most concise. We'll show this way first.

<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

We can see that this involves 3-steps:

1. __Instantiating an Empty List:__ We do this to store our results as we make them in the for-loop. 

2. __For-Each filename, read and append:__ We read using `pd.read_csv()`, which returns a data frame for each path. Then we append each data frame to our list. 

3. __Combine each Data Frame:__ We use `pd.concat()` to combine the list of data frames into one big data frame. 

__PRO-TIP:__ Combining data frames in lists is a common strategy. Don't forget to use `axis=0` to specify row-wise combining.  





## Method 2: Using Map

The `map()` function is a more concise way to iterate. The advantage is that we don't have to instantiate a list. However, it can be more confusing to beginners. 

### How it works:

Map takes in two general arguments:

1. __func:__ A function to iteratively apply

2. __*iterables__: One or more iterables that are supplied to the function in order of the functions arguments.

## Let's use it. 

Ok, so let's try `map()`.

<p class='text-center date'> 
  <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a>
</p>

We use 3-steps:

1. __Make a Lambda Function:__ This is an anonymous function that we create on the fly with the first argument that will accept our iterable (each filename in our list of csv file paths). 

2. __Supply the iterable:__ In this case, we provide our list of csv files. The map function will then iteratively supply each element to the function in succession. 

3. __Convert to List:__ The `map()` function returns a map object. We can then convert this to a list using the `list()` function. 

__PRO-TIP:__ Beginners can be confused by the "map object" that is returned. Just simply use the `list()` function to extract the results of `map()` in a list structure.   

## Method 3: List Comprehension

Because we are returning a list, even easier than `map()`, we can use a __List Comprehension.__ A list comprehension is a streamlined way of making a for-loop that returns a list. Here's how it works.

</p>

1. __Do this__: Add the function that you want to iterate. The parameter must match your looping variable name (next).

2. __For each of these__: This is your looping variable name that you create inside of the list comprehension. Each of these are elements that will get passed to your function. 

3. __In this:__ This is your iterable. The list containing each of our file paths. 


# Summary

There you have it. You now know how to read CSV files using 3 methods:

1. For-Loops
2. Map
3. List Comprehension
