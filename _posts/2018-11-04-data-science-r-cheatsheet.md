Teaching R is our mission at [__Business Science University__](https://university.business-science.io/) because __R is the most efficient language for exploring data, performing business analysis, and applying data science to business to extract ROI for an organization__. R has an amazing ecosystem of tools that seemlessly work together, which has been termed the "tidyverse". The "tidyverse" ecosystem can take business analysis to a new level. __Here's the key: 99.9% of business analysts don't know R (and its awesome power). With our learning system, you can learn R quickly, setting yourself on a career tragectory in data science.__

At [Business Science](https://www.business-science.io), We are developing a __revolutionary new system for teaching _Business Analysis with R___ (Business Analysis with R is a new course we are developing at [Business Science University](https://university.business-science.io/)). The system is revolutionary for a number of reasons (we'll get to these in a minute). The cornerstone of our teaching process is the [Data Science with R Workflow](/r-cheatsheet.html) that was originally taught by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund in the the excellent book, [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). __The [NEW R Cheatsheet](/r-cheatsheet.html) links the documentation, cheatsheets, and key resources available for every R package in the data science with R workflow into one meta-cheatsheet that illustrates the workflow__.

## How To Use The Cheatsheet

The __NEW R cheatsheet__ is an amazing reference. It contains every resource you need for referencing the tidyverse documentation in one spot. Let's take a look.


### The Workflow

The first thing you will notice is the workflow that is prominently presented. You can see where the various R Packages are used.
