`tidyquant`, version 0.3.0, is a pretty sizable release that includes a little bit for everyone, including __new financial charting and moving average geoms__ for use with `ggplot2`, a new `tq_get` get option called `"key.stats"` for retrieving __real-time stock information__, and several nice integrations that improve the ease of __scaling__ your analyses. If your not already familiar with `tidyquant`, it integrates the best quantitative resources for collecting and analyzing quantitative data, `xts`, `zoo`, `quantmod` and `TTR`, with the `tidyverse` allowing for seamless interaction between each. I'll briefly touch on some of the updates by going through some [neat examples](#examples). The package is open source, and you can view the code on the [tidyquant github page](https://github.com/mdancho84/tidyquant).

# v0.3.0 Updates <a class="anchor" id="updates"></a>

> tidyquant: Bringing financial analysis to the tidyverse

When I said this was a big release, I wasn't kidding. We have some major enhancements in `tidyquant`:

1. __Financial Visualizations for ggplot2__: Candlestick charts, barcharts, moving averages and Bollinger Bands can be used in the `ggplot` "grammar of graphics" workflow. There's a new vignette, [Charting with tidyquant](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyquant), that details the new financial charting capabilities. 
 
    
2. __Key stats from Yahoo Finance__: Users can now get _55 different key statistics in real-time from Yahoo Finance_ with the new `"key.stats"` get option. The statistics include Bid, Ask, Day's High, Day's Low, Last Trade Price, Current P/E Ratio, and many more most of which change throughout the day. With the addition of the key statistics, `tq_get` is now truly a _one-stop shop for financial information_. The user can now get:
    * Real-time key stock statistics with `"key.stats"`
    * Historical key ratios and financial information over the past 10-years with `"key.ratios"`
    * Quarterly and annual financial statement data with `"financials"`
    * Historical daily stock prices with `"stock.prices"` 
    * Stock indexes for 18 different indexes with `"stock.index"`
    * And more!

    
3. __Enhancements that Make Scaling Financial Analysis Simple__: 
    
    * `tq_get` now accepts multiple stocks in the form of either a character vector (e.g. `c("AAPL", "GOOG", "FB")`) or a data frame with the stocks in the first column. This means scaling is ridiculously simple now. A call to `tq_get(c("AAPL", "GOOG", "FB"), get = "stock.prices")` now gets the 10-years of daily stock prices for all three stocks in one data frame! 
    
    *  `tq_mutate` and `tq_transform` now work with grouped data frames. This means that you can extend the `xts`, `zoo`, `quantmod` and `TTR` functions to grouped data frames the same way that you can with `dplyr::mutate`. In addition, you can now more easily rename the transformed / mutated data frame, with the `col_rename` argument. All of this saves you time and requires less code!


This concludes the major changes. Now, let's go through some examples!



# Prerequisites <a class="anchor" id="prerequisites"></a>

First, update to `tidyquant` v0.3.0. 


{% highlight r %}
install.packages("tidyquant")
{% endhighlight %}

Next, load `tidyquant`.


{% highlight r %}
# Loads tidyquant, tidyverse, lubridate, quantmod, TTR, xts, zoo
library(tidyquant)
{% endhighlight %}

I also recommend the open-source [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE, which makes _R Programming_ easy and efficient.

# Examples

We've got some neat examples to show off the new capabilities:

1. [Enhanced Financial Data Visualizations](#example1): We'll check out how to use the new `tidyquant` geoms with `ggplot2`, which provide great visualizations for time-series and stock data!  

2. [Working with Key Statistics](#example2): We'll investigate the new `tq_get` get option, `get = "key.stats"`, which enables __access to real-time, intraday trading information__!

3. [Scaling Your Analysis](#example3): We'll test out some of the new scaling features that make it even easier to scale your analysis from one security to many!

## Example 1: Enhanced Financial Data Visualizations <a class="anchor" id="example1"></a>

![Multiple Stocks](/assets/tidyquant-030.png)


I absolutely love these new ggplot geoms that come packaged with `tidyquant`, and I'm really excited to show them off! Two new chart types come packaged with `tidyquant` v0.3.0: `geom_candlestick` and `geom_barchart` (not to be confused with `geom_bar`). In this post, we'll focus on the candlestick chart, but the barchart works in a very similar manner.


Before we start, let's get some data using `tq_get`. The first call gets a single stock (nothing new here), and the second call retrieves the FANG stocks using the [new scaling functionality](#example3) by piping (`%>%`) a character vector of symbols to `tq_get` (there are other ways too!).


{% highlight r %}
AMZN <- tq_get("AMZN", get = "stock.prices", from = "2007-01-01", to = "2017-01-01")
FANG <- c("FB", "AMZN", "NFLX", "GOOG") %>%
    tq_get(get = "stock.prices", from = "2007-01-01", to = "2017-01-01")
{% endhighlight %}

Before v0.3.0, we used `geom_line` to create a line chart like so. Note that `coord_x_date` is a new `tidyquant` coordinate function that enables zooming in a part of the chart without out-of-bounds data loss (`scale_x_date` is similar but causes out-of-bounds data loss which wreaks havoc on moving average geoms). 


{% highlight r %}
# Setup dates for zoom window
end <- ymd("2017-01-01")
start <- end - weeks(20)
# Create chart
AMZN %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
    geom_line() + 
    labs(title = "AMZN: Line Chart the Previous Way",
         subtitle = "This is good, but doesn't give us open, high, low, or direction information",
         x = "", y = "Closing Price") +
    coord_x_date(xlim = c(start, end),
                 ylim = c(700, 870))
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](/figure/source/2017-1-22-tidyquant-update-0-3-0/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)


With `tidyquant`, we can replace the `geom_line` with `geom_candlestick` to create a beautiful candlestick chart that shows open, high, low, close, and direction visually. The only real difference is that we need to specify the aesthetic arguments, `open`, `high`, `low` and `close`. Everything else can stay the same.


{% highlight r %}
AMZN %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
    geom_candlestick(aes(open = open, close = close, high = high, low = low)) + 
    labs(title = "AMZN: New Candlestick Geom!",
         subtitle = "Visually shows open, high, low, and close information, along with direction",
         x = "", y = "Closing Price") +
    coord_x_date(xlim = c(start, end),
                 ylim = c(700, 870))
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](/figure/source/2017-1-22-tidyquant-update-0-3-0/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)


Pretty sweet! Let's take this a step further with moving averages. The moving average geom, `geom_ma`, is used to quickly draw moving average lines using a moving average function, `ma_fun`, that is one of seven from the `TTR` package. We can use these to _"rapid prototype"_ moving averages, enabling us to quickly identify changes in trends. Let's add 15 and 50-day moving averages. Note that `geom_ma` takes arguments to control the moving average function (`ma_fun = SMA` and `n = 15`) and arguments to control the line such as `color = "red"` or `linetype = 4`.


{% highlight r %}
AMZN %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
    geom_candlestick(aes(open = open, close = close, high = high, low = low)) + 
    geom_ma(ma_fun = SMA, n = 15, size = 1) + 
    geom_ma(ma_fun = SMA, n = 50, color = "red", linetype = 4, size = 1) + 
    labs(title = "AMZN: New Candlestick Geom + Moving Averages!",
         subtitle = "Adding MA's is fast and easy enabling rapid prototyping",
         x = "", y = "Closing Price") +
    coord_x_date(xlim = c(start, end),
                 ylim = c(700, 870))
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](/figure/source/2017-1-22-tidyquant-update-0-3-0/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

We can also use [Bollinger Bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollinger_Bands) to help visualize volatility. BBands take a moving average, such as `ma_fun = SMA` from `TTR`, and a standard deviation, `sd = 2` by default. Because BBands depend on the high, low and close prices, we need to add these as aesthetic arguments. Let's use a 20-day simple moving average with two standard deviations. We can see that there were two periods, one in October and one in November, that had higher volatility. 


{% highlight r %}
AMZN %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
    geom_candlestick(aes(open = open, close = close, high = high, low = low)) + 
    geom_bbands(aes(high = high, low = low, close = close),
                ma_fun = SMA, n = 20, sd = 2, size = 1) + 
    labs(title = "AMZN: New Candlestick Geom + BBands!",
         subtitle = "Quickly visualize volatility",
         x = "", y = "Closing Price") +
    coord_x_date(xlim = c(start, end),
                 ylim = c(700, 870))
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7](/figure/source/2017-1-22-tidyquant-update-0-3-0/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

Last, we can visualize multiple stocks at once by adding a `group` aesthetic and tacking on a `facet_wrap` at the end of the `ggplot` workflow. Note that the out-of-bounds data becomes important to the scale of the facet: too much data and the y-axis is off scale, too little data and the moving average is thrown off. An easy way to adjust is to use `filter()` to subtract double the moving average number of periods (`2 * n`) from the start date of the data. This reduces the out-of-bounds data without eliminating data that the moving average function needs for calculations.


{% highlight r %}
n <- 20
FANG %>%
    filter(date >= start - days(2 * n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close, group = symbol.x)) +
    geom_candlestick(aes(open = open, close = close, high = high, low = low)) + 
    geom_bbands(aes(high = high, low = low, close = close),
                ma_fun = SMA, n = n, sd = 2, size = 0.5) + 
    labs(title = "Multiple Stocks at Once!",
         subtitle = "Quickly visualize the volatility of four stocks at once",
         x = "", y = "Closing Price") +
    coord_x_date(xlim = c(start, end)) +
    facet_wrap(~ symbol.x, scales = "free_y")
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8](/figure/source/2017-1-22-tidyquant-update-0-3-0/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

## Example 2: Working with Key Statistics <a class="anchor" id="example2"></a>

New to `tq_get` is the get option `get = "key.stats"`. So, what are key stats? Yahoo Finance has an amazing list of __real-time statistics__ such as bid price, ask price, day's high, day's low, change, and many more features that change throughout the day. Key stats are our access to _live data_, the most current features of a stock / company, many of which are accurate to the second that they are retrieved. Pretty neat!

##### Getting Key Stats

Let's get some key stats, and see what's inside. We get key stats using the `tq_get` function, setting `get = "key.stats"`.  When we show the data, it's kind of messy (there's a reason) so I've just listed the first ten column names. It comes in the form of a one row tibble (tidy data frame) that has 55 columns, one for each key stat. 


{% highlight r %}
AAPL_key_stats <- tq_get("AAPL", get = "key.stats")
colnames(AAPL_key_stats)[1:10]
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
##  [1] "Ask"                               
##  [2] "Ask.Size"                          
##  [3] "Average.Daily.Volume"              
##  [4] "Bid"                               
##  [5] "Bid.Size"                          
##  [6] "Book.Value"                        
##  [7] "Change"                            
##  [8] "Change.From.200.day.Moving.Average"
##  [9] "Change.From.50.day.Moving.Average" 
## [10] "Change.From.52.week.High"
{% endhighlight %}

The reason that the data comes this way is because, using the [new scaling capability](#example3), we can get key stats for multiple stocks, and the rows get stacked on top of each other. This makes comparing key stats very easy!


{% highlight r %}
c("FB", "AMZN", "NFLX", "GOOG") %>%
    tq_get(get = "key.stats") %>%
    select(symbol.x, Bid, Bid.Size, Ask, Ask.Size, Open, Change)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 4 × 7
##   symbol.x    Bid Bid.Size    Ask Ask.Size   Open Change
##      <chr>  <dbl>    <int>  <dbl>    <int>  <dbl>  <dbl>
## 1       FB 127.00      300 127.07      100 128.10  -0.51
## 2     AMZN 807.52      100 808.73      100 815.28  -0.71
## 3     NFLX 138.30      100 138.60      300 139.36   0.19
## 4     GOOG 800.00      100 814.00      100 806.91   2.85
{% endhighlight %}

##### Retrieve Real-Time Data at Periodic Intervals

Something great about real-time data is that it can be collected at periodic intervals when trading is in-session! The following code chunk when run will retrieve stock prices at a periodic interval:


{% highlight r %}
collect_real_time_data <- function(x, interval_sec, n) {
    data <- tibble()
    while (n > 0) {
        data <- bind_rows(data, tq_get(x, get = "key.stats"))
        Sys.sleep(interval_sec)
        n <- n - 1
    }
    return(data)
}
collect_real_time_data("AAPL", interval_sec = 3, n = 5) %>%
    select(Ask, Ask.Size, Bid, Bid.Size, Open, Change)
{% endhighlight %}

##### Comparing Historical Data to Current Data

We now have `get = "key.stats"` for current stats and with v0.2.0 we got `get = "key.ratios"` for 10-years of historical ratios. When combined, we can now compare current attributes to historical trends. To put into perspective, we will investigate the __P/E Ratio: Comparing Historical Trends Versus Current Value__ for AAPL. The [P/E ratio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) is a measure of the stock valuation. Stocks are considered "expensive" when they trade above historical averages or above industry averages. 

We already have the __key stats__ from AAPL, so getting the current P/E Ratio is very easy.


{% highlight r %}
AAPL_key_stats$PE.Ratio
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] 14.44
{% endhighlight %}

Due to the amount of data and time-series nature, the __key ratios__ come as a nested tibble, grouped by section type.


{% highlight r %}
AAPL_key_ratios <- tq_get("AAPL", get = "key.ratios")
AAPL_key_ratios
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 7 × 2
##             section               data
##               <chr>             <list>
## 1        Financials <tibble [150 × 5]>
## 2     Profitability <tibble [170 × 5]>
## 3            Growth <tibble [160 × 5]>
## 4         Cash Flow  <tibble [50 × 5]>
## 5  Financial Health <tibble [240 × 5]>
## 6 Efficiency Ratios  <tibble [80 × 5]>
## 7  Valuation Ratios  <tibble [40 × 5]>
{% endhighlight %}

We need to get the historical P/E Ratios, which are in the "Valuation Ratios" section. We will do a series of filtering and unnesting to peel away the layers and isolate the "Price to Earnings" time-series data. 


{% highlight r %}
AAPL_historical_pe_ratios <- AAPL_key_ratios %>%
    filter(section == "Valuation Ratios") %>%
    unnest() %>%
    filter(category == "Price to Earnings") %>%
    select(category, date, value)
AAPL_historical_pe_ratios
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 10 × 3
##             category       date    value
##                <chr>     <date>    <dbl>
## 1  Price to Earnings 2007-12-31 46.02575
## 2  Price to Earnings 2008-12-31 11.44933
## 3  Price to Earnings 2009-12-31 21.09266
## 4  Price to Earnings 2010-12-31 19.43144
## 5  Price to Earnings 2011-12-30 13.34155
## 6  Price to Earnings 2012-12-31 11.07157
## 7  Price to Earnings 2013-12-31 13.29209
## 8  Price to Earnings 2014-12-31 16.46026
## 9  Price to Earnings 2015-12-31 11.16801
## 10 Price to Earnings 2016-12-30 13.93742
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we are ready to visualize the _P/E Ratio: Comparing Historical Trends Versus Current Value_ for AAPL. The visualization below is inspired by [r-statistics.co](http://r-statistics.co/), an awesome resource for `ggplot2` and R analysis. We add the following:

* Geoms:
    1. `geom_line()` and `geom_point()` to chart the historical data 
    2. `geom_ma()` to chart the three period simple moving average (the three period average helps identify the trend through the noise)
    3. `geom_hline()` to add a horizontal line at current P/E Ratio obtained from key stats.
* Legend: We manipulate the colors with `scale_color_manual()` and the position in the `theme()` function.
* Logo: A logo is generated as a `grob` (grid graphical object) using the `grid` and `png` packages. The function `annotate_custom()` allows us to simply add to the ggplot workflow. See [Add an Image to Background](http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part2-Customizing-Theme-With-R-Code.html#Add%20an%20Image%20in%20Background) for a tutorial.

The chart shows that the current valuation is slightly above the recent historical valuation indicating that the stock prices is slightly "expensive". However, given that the P/E ratio is below the current SP500 average of 25, courtesy of [www.multpl.com](http://www.multpl.com/), one could also consider this stock "inexpensive". It just depends on your perspective. :)

## Example 3: Scaling Your Analysis <a class="anchor" id="example3"></a>

Probably the single most important benefit of performing financial analysis in the `tidyverse` is the ability to scale. Based on some excellent feedback from [@KanAugust](https://twitter.com/KanAugust), I have made scaling even easier. There's two new options for scaling:

__New Option 1: Passing a character vector of symbols__:

Send a character vector in the form `c("X", "Y", "Z")` to `tq_get`. A new column is generated, `symbol.x`, with the symbols that were passed to the `x` argument. 


{% highlight r %}
c("FB", "GOOG", "AAPL") %>%
    tq_get(get = "stock.prices")
{% endhighlight %}

__New Option 2: Passing a tibble with symbols in the first column__:

We can combine `tq_get` calls using `get = "stock.index"` and `get = "stock.prices"` to pass a stock index to get stock prices. I've added `slice(1:3)` to get the first three stocks from the index, which reduces the download time. If you remove `slice(1:3)`, you will get the historical prices for all stocks in an index in the next step! 

First, get stocks from an index.


{% highlight r %}
NASDAQ_first_three <- tq_get("NASDAQ100", get = "stock.index") %>%
    slice(1:3) 
NASDAQ_first_three
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## # A tibble: 3 × 2
##   symbol             company
##    <chr>               <chr>
## 1    MMM                  3M
## 2    ABT ABBOTT LABORATORIES
## 3   ABBV          ABBVIE INC
{% endhighlight %}

Then get stock prices. Note that symbols must be in the first column.


{% highlight r %}
NASDAQ_first_three <- NASDAQ_first_three %>%
    tq_get(get = "stock.prices")
NASDAQ_first_three
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}

We can also use `tq_mutate` and `tq_transform` with `dplyr::group_by` to scale analyses! Thanks to some great feedback from [@dvaughan32](https://twitter.com/dvaughan32), the `col_rename` argument is available to conveniently rename the newly transformed / mutated columns.


{% highlight r %}
NASDAQ_first_three %>%
    group_by(symbol) %>%
    tq_mutate(ohlc_fun = Ad, mutate_fun = SMA, n = 5, col_rename = "SMA.5") %>%
    select(-(open:volume))
{% endhighlight %}

__Here's a powerful example__: We can use `group_by` and `tq_transform` to collect annual returns for a tibble of stock prices for multiple stocks. The result can be piped to `ggplot` for charting.


{% highlight r %}
NASDAQ_first_three %>%
    group_by(company) %>%
    tq_transform(Ad, periodReturn, period = "yearly", col_rename = "Annual.Returns") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = year(date), y = Annual.Returns, fill = company)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2007, 2017, by = 1)) +
    labs(title = "First three companies in SP500: Charting Annual Returns", 
         subtitle = "tq_mutate and tq_transform can be used at scale to quickly visualize returns", 
         x = "") +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
{% endhighlight %}

# Conclusions <a class="anchor" id="conclusion"></a>

The `tidyquant` package has several enhancements for financial analysis:

* New `ggplot2` geoms for candlestick charts, barcharts, moving averages, and Bollinger Bands, and [a brand new vignette](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyquant) to help guide users on charting capabilities. 

* New `get = "key.stats"` for current stats on stocks: 55 total are available. The key stats compliment the key ratios (`get = "key.ratios"), which contain 10-years of historical information on various key ratios and financial information.

* New capabilities for scaling financial analyses to many stocks: 
    * Using `tq_get` with character vectors or tibbles of stocks
    * Using `tq_mutate` / `tq_transform` with `dplyr::group_by` 

With these updates, we can really do full financial analyses without ever leaving the `tidyverse`!

# Recap <a class="anchor" id="recap"></a>

We went over a few examples to illustrate the main updates to `tidyquant`: 

1. The first example showed an implementation of several new `tidyquant` geoms that work with `ggplot2`: `geom_candlestick` / `geom_barchart`, `geom_ma`, and `geom_bbands`. 

2. The second example showed use of the new `tq_get` get option, `get = "key.stats"`. The key stats provide real-time data from Yahoo Finance, and are a handy complement to the historical data provided using get options, `"stock.prices"`, `"key.ratios"`, and `"financials"`. 

3. The third and final example showed some of the improvements in scaling analysis with the `tidyverse`. You can now pipe multiple symbols into `tq_get` to scale any of the get options, and you can use `tq_mutate` and `tq_transform` with `dplyr::group_by`. 

I hope you enjoy the new features as much as I did creating them. As always there's more to come! :)
