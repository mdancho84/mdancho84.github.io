# Why should you learn Generative AI if your a data professional?

Over the past 6 months, Iâ€™ve been working with Python, Generative AI, and LLMs daily. And on May 30th, Iâ€™m excited to share what Iâ€™ve learned. ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

## The demand for AI talent is skyrocketing. 

According to the Silicon Valley Business Journal, the typical AI engineer at OpenAI makes $925,000 a year.

Thatâ€™s almost a million dollars. And itâ€™s 3X the industry median for software engineers. Hereâ€™s why this is happening everywhere (and how you can be part of the great AI shift). 

AI is changing the way businesses work, people get information, and processes happen. And the people who can build AI have unlimited career potential. 

## New Role: The AI Business Scientist

While AI is replacing some jobs, itâ€™s creating a new role: the AI Business Scientist.  

And that's why I'm excited to announce a new course is coming to my Business Science portfolio.

I'm showcasing how to take your data science skills to become the AI expert for your organization...

... using Python's strengths:

* ðŸ’¥ `OpenAI`
* ðŸ’¥ `LangChain`
* ðŸ’¥ `Streamlit`
* ðŸ’¥ `Scikit Learn`
* ðŸ’¥ `H2O`
* ðŸ’¥ `FastAPI`

## Complete 4 AI Projects

This course is like no other where I will teach you how to complete 4 AI projects that progressively build your AI and LLM skills:

### ðŸ‘‰ **Project 1: A custom streamlit web app to make summary PDF business reports from 100â€™s of pages of call transcripts**

![AI course Fast Track Project](/assets/ai_course_fast_track_app.jpg)

### ðŸ‘‰ **Project 2: An AI-powered Marketing Strategy Assistant trained from a Marketing Strategy knowledge database (RAG Project)**

### ðŸ‘‰ **Project 3: A Customer Analytics AI Agent that combines Machine Learning, SQL Database, and Pandas skills and reports visualizations and tables based on your questions**

### ðŸ‘‰ **Project 4: A Multi-Agent App with a Supervisor Bot that controls your AI Marketing and BI bots**
