# ‚ùå Excel is killing your analysis

Listen, if you are still doing analysis, modeling and reporting in Excel, then did you know:

1. **90% of Excel spreadsheets contain errors**
2. R can be used to automate the reporting process saving you tons of time every month
3. **Your boss won't care how you do it, as long as it's done right the first time **

So if you're sending your boss an analysis that's Excel...

![Cash Flow Statement in Excel](/assets/065_cash_flow_statement_table_in_Excel.jpg)

...And, if **one small error** throws off your analysis by *$20,000,000,000* (yes, that's $20 Billion with a "B"), then your boss isn't going to be too happy when their shareholders dump billions in stock (because something was mis-reported).

# ‚úÖ R can make awesome tables

What if you could make a better looking table in R, and virtually guarantee your analysis models were error free? 

**You can with R!** And here's the same Cash Flow Statement table in R to prove it: 

![Cash Flow Statement in R](/assets/065_cash_flow_statement_table_in_R.jpg)

This table can be popped into a PDF or Word document straight from R. And more importantly, the analysis that made the table can be automated from R, virtually eliminating Spreadsheet errors. 

**So today, I'm going to share how to convert this Cash Flow Statement from Excel to R.**

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Excel Data.</strong></a> </p>

## Step 4: Data Manipulation

We need to get the raw cash flow data into the right format for the Cash Flow Table. Run this code to get the data prepared:

![Data Preparation Code](/assets/065_04_data_preparation.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

## Code explanation:

The code performs a series of transformations and manipulations on a data frame called `cashflow_raw_tbl` to create a new data frame `cashflow_wide_tbl`:

1. **`cashflow_wide_tbl <- cashflow_raw_tbl %>%`**:
   This initializes a pipeline with the `%>%` operator, where `cashflow_raw_tbl` is the input data frame. The output of the entire pipeline operation will be assigned to `cashflow_wide_tbl`.

2. **`clean_names() %>%`**:
   This function from the `janitor` package cleans up column names by converting them to lower case and replacing spaces with underscores, among other things. This makes it easier to refer to column names in the code later.

3. **`rowid_to_column("item_id") %>%`**:
   This function adds a new column named "item_id" to the data frame, which contains the row numbers.

4. **`rename(item_name = in_million_usd) %>%`**:
   This renames the column "in_million_usd" to "item_name".

5. **`mutate(group_id = c(1,1,1,1,1, 2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3,3, 4,4,4)) %>%`**:
   This creates a new column "group_id" by assigning a group ID to each row in a specified sequence.

6. **`mutate(item_type = c(...)) %>%`**:
   This creates a new column "item_type" with the specified sequence of "input" and "output".

7. **`select(group_id, starts_with("item"), everything()) %>%`**:
   This rearranges the columns to start with "group_id", followed by columns starting with "item", and then all other columns.

8. **`mutate(across(starts_with("fy_"), ~ replace_na(., 0))) %>%`**:
   This replaces all NA values in the columns starting with "fy_" with 0.

9. **`rowwise() %>%`**:
   This changes the data frame to a row-wise format, which is useful when applying functions that should operate on rows rather than columns.

10. **`mutate(trend = list(c_across(fy_09:fy_18))) %>%`**:
    In this row-wise format, this line creates a new "trend" column by collating the values from the columns "fy_09" to "fy_18" into a list for each row.

11. **`ungroup()`**:
    Finally, this undoes the previous grouping operation, returning the data frame to a normal (non row-wise) format.

The resulting `cashflow_wide_tbl` data frame contains cleaned and organized data, ready for further analysis or visualization.

## Step 5: Make the Table in R



Finally, we are ready to make the table in R. Run this code:

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

### Code Explanation:

1. **`cashflow_wide_tbl %>%`**:
   This line initializes a pipeline using the `%>%` operator from the `magrittr` package. `cashflow_wide_tbl` is the input data frame (presumably in wide format) that will be passed through the subsequent functions.

2. **`gt() %>%`**:
   Calls the `gt` function to create a `gt` table object from the input data. The `gt` package is used for rendering tables in HTML, which can be viewed in various output formats like Markdown, HTML, and others.

3. **`gtExtras::gt_plt_sparkline(trend) %>%`**:
   Utilizes the `gtExtras` package to add a sparkline plot to the table for the "trend" column. Sparklines are small, simple line graphs typically used to represent a trend over time.

4. **`tab_header(title = "Cash Flow Statement", subtitle = "Exxon Mobil (FY2009 - FY2018)") %>%`**:
   Sets the table header with the title "Cash Flow Statement" and subtitle "Exxon Mobil (FY2009 - FY2018)."

5. **`tab_spanner(label = "Fiscal Year (Values in Millions)", columns = fy_09:fy_18,) %>%`**:
   Adds a spanner header across columns `fy_09` to `fy_18` with the label "Fiscal Year (Values in Millions)."

6. **`cols_label(...)`**:
   This function is used to set custom labels for columns in the table. For instance, the `item_id` column is renamed to "Item No.", and the fiscal year columns are renamed to their corresponding years.

7. **`fmt_currency(columns  = fy_09:fy_18, decimals = 0, accounting = TRUE) %>%`**:
   Formats the fiscal year columns as currency with no decimals and in accounting format (e.g., using parentheses for negative numbers).

8. **`cols_align(align = "center") %>%`**:
   Aligns all columns in the center.

9. **`gtExtras::gt_highlight_rows(rows = item_type == "output", fill = "lightgrey") %>%`**:
   Highlights rows where the `item_type` column equals "output" with a light grey background.

10. **`cols_hide(columns = c(item_type, group_id)) %>%`**:
    Hides the `item_type` and `group_id` columns from the final table display.

11. **`tab_options(...)`**:
    Sets various table options like font sizes and weights. Here, it customizes the size of the title, subtitle, table font, and makes column labels bold.

The final table looks amazing and is ready to add in to your financial report:
