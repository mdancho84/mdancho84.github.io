# What Is Exploratory Data Analysis?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is how data scientists and data analysts find meaningful information in the form of relationships in the data. EDA is absolutely critical as a first step before machine learning and to **explain business insights** to non-technical stakeholders like executives and business leadership.

# What do I make in this R-Tip?

I'm so excited right now. If you follow me, you probably know one of my favorite R packages is the `skimr` library for [**quick exploratory statistical summaries**](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2021/03/09/data-quality-with-skimr.html) (the first thing I run when I get a new dataset). Well, I just stumbled upon _the interactive version_ of skimr. And it's insane!

I'm referring to `dataxray`, a new R package that provides quick statistical summaries in an interactive table inside of the Rstudio Viewer Pane. Here's the interactive `dataxray` table you're going to make in this tutorial from R. ðŸ‘‡

# My 3-Step Exploratory Data Analysis Process

**It can be confusing to know which EDA R packages to use.** To help, I've recently covered [my top R packages for exploratory data analysis here](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2022/09/23/explore-simplified-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-in-r.html). In short, here's my process:

1. **DataExplorer (and Skimr):** For collecting a report on the dataset that I'm unfamiliar with. I focus on which feature I'm interested in (called a "target") and the surrounding data to identify any data issues. [I cover my DataExplorer process here](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2021/03/02/use-dataexplorer-for-EDA.html). And, [I show off how I use skimr here](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2021/03/09/data-quality-with-skimr.html).
2. **Correlation Funnel:** I then use this to get a quick understanding (full disclosure - I am the creator of this package, but make no mistake it's probably the most powerful package for getting quick insights in your arsenal). [I cover how I use Correlation Funnel here.](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2019/08/07/correlationfunnel.html)
3. **Explore:** If I want to further understand complex relationships, I'll use the explore package's shiny app to expose bivariate relationships and drill in. I explain [how to use explore here](https://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2022/09/23/explore-simplified-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-in-r.html).

# With all these great EDA packages, why use `dataxray`?

What I like about `dataxray` is its emphasis on an **interactive exploration** of the exploratory summaries. This goes beyond what `skimr` offers (the gold standard) by adding an interactive exploration element to feature summaries. So if you like interactivity, then try `dataxray`.

# Tutorial: Interactive exploratory summaries with `dataxray`

Here's how to use `dataxray` to start your exploratory data analysis on the right foot. 

## Step 1: Load the libraries and data

First, load libraries `tidyverse` , `dataxray`, and (optionally) `correlationfunnel` for the bonus code. 

![](/assets/dataxray_01_libraries.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

Weâ€™ll use the `mpg` dataset, which has data on 234 vehicle models.

<br>

## Step 2: Make the Dataxray Table

Next, just use two functions: 

1. `make_xray()` to convert the raw data to preformatted data for the reactable interactive table
2. `view_xray()` to display the interactive exploratory table using the underlying reactable library. 

![](/assets/dataxray_code.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

The result is an amazing reactable table that allows us to drill into each feature.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Dataxray

Now you can explore each feature (column in your data) to see:

1. **Count and Percent Missing - How many `NA` values**
2. Number of Distinct - How many unique observations
3. **Categorical Data - Bar charts for frequency by category**
4. Numeric Data - Distribution with histogram and quantiles
5. **Expandable Groups - I love this feature. You can expand the groups to find out more information about the features.** 
6. Search Features - Use regex to search the name. Great if you have a lot of features (columns).

# Bonus: Correlation Funnel

The next step in my 3-step process is to immediately move to business insights. I can't tell you how important it is to get a quick win for your stakeholders. Whether it's your boss, a business executive in the C-suite, or your client if you are a consultant. You need to get insights fast. 

![](/assets/correlationfunnel_plot-2.jpg)

So here's how I do it. 

## Step 1: Run correlation funnel

Here's the code (make sure you have `correlationfunnel` loaded). 

![](/assets/correlationfunnel_code-1.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter' target ='_blank'>Get the code.</a> </p>

### The only trick is to pick which target to hone in on. 

Here's how. 

* **The `binarize()` function bins the data, which converts everything to 1 and 0.** 
* The `glimpse()` function is used to see all of the column names, which have been expanded from the binning operation.
* **The `correlate()` function creates the raw insights. The only trick is to pick which target.** 
* _How to pick a target?_ For numeric features like `hwy`, it gets binned. So I'm going to hone in on the bin `hwy__27_Inf`, which is basically like saying, "I want to know which features in my data are related to greater fuel economy (fuel efficiency)
* **Then run `plot_correlation_funnel`_`()` a_ to expose the key relationships in a visualization.**

## Step 2: Review the Correlation Funnel Plot

The resulting visualization looks like this. And you can quickly expose the insights in your data. 

![](/assets/correlationfunnel_plot-2.jpg)

I can easily see that:

* **Positive Correlation to Highway Fuel Economy:** If the vehicle has high city fuel economy, low engine displacement (smaller engine size), 4 cylinders, front-wheel drive, is a Volkswagen or Honda, is a Civic or Corolla Model, and is a Compact, Subcompact, or Midsize. 
* **Negative Correlation to Highway Fuel Economy:** When engine size is 4.6Liter or lager, 8 cylinder, 4-wheel drive, Dodge or Ford Manufacturers, and SUV and Pickup class

Not bad for 5 minutes of effort. 

# ðŸ’¡ Conclusions

You learned how to use the `dataxray` library to create an interactive exploratory summary report AND perform exploratory analysis the fast way with `correlationfunnel`. Great work! **But, thereâ€™s a lot more to becoming a data scientist.**

# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn how to apply data science to business. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.

I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever-increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

**If you feel like this, you're not alone.**

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. **Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught from a business perspective**
2. **Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.**
