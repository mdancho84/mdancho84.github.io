> A gentle introduction to our forecasting package, `modeltime`. Modeltime extends the Tidymodels ecosystem for time series forecasting. Learn how to forecast with ARIMA, Prophet, and linear regression time series models in this short video tutorial.

This article is part of R-Tips Weekly, a <a href="https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter" target="_blank">weekly video tutorial</a> that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

# Get the Code

The video tutorial comes with [__100-lines of code__](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter) that takes you step-by-step through a introductory forecasting with:

- __Auto ARIMA__: An automatic forecasting algorithm that ships with `modeltime`.

- __Prophet__: A forecasting algorithm made by Facebook that works well with daily data (and also ships with `modeltime`).

- __Linear Regression (Penalized)__: A machine learning approach to time series forecasting that is made available with `tidymodels`.

# It gets better<br><small>You've just scratched the surface, here's what's coming...</small>

The Modeltime Ecosystem functionality is much more feature-rich than what we've covered here (I couldn't possibly cover everything in this post). ðŸ˜€

Here's what I didn't cover:

- __Feature Engineering:__ We can make this forecast much more accurate by including features from competition-winning strategies   

- __Ensemble Modeling:__ We can stack H2O Models with other models not included in H2O like GluonTS Deep Learning.

- __Deep Learning:__ We can use GluonTS Deep Learning for developing high-performance, scalable forecasts.

### So how are you ever going to <span style='color:#18bc9c'>learn time series analysis and forecasting?</span>

You're probably thinking:

- There's so much to learn
- My time is precious
- I'll never learn time series

I have good news that will put those doubts behind you. 

You can learn time series analysis and forecasting in hours with my [state-of-the-art time series forecasting course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/). ðŸ‘‡
