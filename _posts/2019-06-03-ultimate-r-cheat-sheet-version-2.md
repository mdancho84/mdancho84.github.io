The ___Ultimate R Cheat Sheet___ now covers the `Shinyverse` - An Ecosystem of R Packages for `Shiny` Web Application Development, Deployment, and putting __Machine Learning into Production__. The cheat sheet was created as a teaching tool for our NEW COURSE [___Predictive Web Applications for Business with R Shiny___](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-102-r-shiny-web-application-business-level-1). You can [__download the Cheat Sheet for FREE__](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet.html), but please read on to learn how to use it ___to streamline your learning___.

I created the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet as a way to help ___organize the best of the R ecosystem___. 

![R Cheat Sheet Toolbox](/assets/2019-05-30-r-cheat-sheet/r_cheat_sheet_toolbox.png)

The original concept was _selfish_ - ___I wanted something that I could use for reference___. Something that organized the tools I used frequently and the obscure topics that I needed to have reference to on a case-by-case basis (the special topics that come up every so often).

I put the Cheat Sheet together for me - and it was really useful. But then I got the idea. Maybe others would benefit. 

[I released the Cheat Sheet to the masses in November of 2018](https://www.business-science.io/learning-r/2018/11/04/data-science-r-cheatsheet.html), and within days it was downloaded thousands of times. 

From user feedback, I got the idea that if people are benefiting so much, maybe I should integrate the _Ultimate R Cheat Sheet_ into my [Business Science University Program](https://university.business-science.io).  

## A Great Learning Tool

I first began teaching the Ultimate R Cheatsheet in [_Business Analysis with R (DS4B 101-R)_](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-101-r-business-analysis-r), a course designed to get students learning R for business ___as fast as possible___. My goal was to get students applying the __80/20 Tools__ to real problems that would translate to their work.

> __Speed is critical__ - Student's need to learn and apply the toolbox to their work as fast as possible. Otherwise they don't learn.  

I began the 101 course showing students how the _Ultimate R Cheat Sheet_ works, and what the key references and package-level cheat sheets (denoted "CS") were. Further, as the course progressed, I gave students the most important functions and resources that they applied to solve the business problems. 

## Student's Learned Faster Than Ever

![How Learning Works with the Ultimate R Cheat Sheet](/assets/2019-05-30-r-cheat-sheet/learning_with_ultimate_r_cheatsheet.jpg)

Students love the _Ultimate R Cheat Sheet_. They learn why each R package is important. They experience using each of the package-level cheat sheets and core references. They apply the R packages and key functions within those packages to solve business problems. ___Most importantly - The students learn where to go to find answers to their questions.___

> The Cheat Sheet is a map. It shows you where to go for answers to your questions.

R became less about ___learning the syntax___, and more about ___learning how to solve business problems___ - The problem-solving and critical thinking approach that I engrain in my student's learning path. 

## Student's Became Confident 

Countless success stories have proven to me that the _Ultimate R Cheat Sheet_ is an incredible guide. But it's not the secret sauce. It's just a tool in the system. 

What students gain from ___learning in a strategic, streamlined, business-focused program___ is a sense of confidence that they can tackle their business projects and apply their data science tools to generate business value, measured financially for their organization. 

They get to ask questions and be mentored through the Slack Channel community by me, and hundreds of other data scientists just like them. 

___This builds confidence. This transforms people. This gets results.___

I've learned a lot over the past 2 years of training 600+ students through the [Business Science University platform](https://university.business-science.io/) and through workshops at leading companies. What I've found is that Cheat Sheets are excellent training tools. 

I've seen ___one critical tool being requested___ more than any other for putting __machine learning models into the hands of decision makers__.

To build the Portfolio Optimization application in Shiny, it requires knowledge of many different tools including HTML, CSS, along with the ___Shiny eco-system___ known as the `Shinyverse`.
