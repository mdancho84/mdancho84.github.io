# Automate PowerPoint with R

Here's a common situation, you have to make a **Monday Morning Slide Deck**. It's the same deck each week, just date ranges for your data change. Here's how to automate this process with R!

First, here's what you need to make - **A weekly Stock Report**.

Thinking like a programmer, you can **collect your stock data using date ranges**.

With a little bit of data wrangling with the `tidyverse`, you've got your table extracted & formatted!

Then you use `timetk` to make a sweet plot.
