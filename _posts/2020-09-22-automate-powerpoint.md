Your boss lives on PowerPoint decks. Do you need to create a Slide Deck every week? Let's learn how to **automate PowerPoint** with R, using `officer` and `tidyverse`.

# R-Tips Weekly Newsletter

This article is part of R-Tips Weekly, a <a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter">weekly video tutorial</a> that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks one R-tip at a time.

<p>Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡</p>

# This Tutorial Is Available In Video

I have a companion video tutorial that shows even more secrets (plus mistakes to avoid).  And, I'm finding that a lot of my students prefer the dialogue that goes along with coding. So check out this video to see me running the code in this tutorial. ðŸ‘‡

# Automate PowerPoint with R

Here's a common situation, you have to make a **Monday Morning Slide Deck**. It's the same deck each week, just date ranges for your data change. Here's how to automate this process with R!

First, here's what you need to make - **A weekly Stock Report**.

<br>

Thinking like a programmer, you can **collect your stock data using date ranges**.

With a little bit of data wrangling with the `tidyverse`, you've got your table extracted & formatted!

Then you use `timetk` to make a sweet plot.

<br>

Then you use `officer` to add the table and plot to powerpoint.

You've just **automated your Monday Morning PowerPoint in R**. BOOM! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

# ðŸ’¡ Conclusions

You learned how to automate PowerPoint with R. Great work! **But, there's a lot more to becoming a Business Scientist (my term for an incredibly valuable data scientist that has business skills).**

If you'd like to become a Business Scientist (and have an awesome career, improve your quality of life, enjoy your job, and all the fun that comes along), then I can help with that.

## Step 1: Watch My Free 40-Minute Webinar

Learning data science on your own is hard. I know because **IT TOOK ME 5-YEARS to feel confident.**

AND, I don't want it to take that long for you.

So, I put together a [**FREE 40-minute webinar (a masterclass)**](https://learn.business-science.io/free-rtrack-masterclass-signup) that provides a roadmap for what worked for me.

<p style="font-size: 36px;text-align: center;"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/free-rtrack-masterclass-signup">Join My FREE 40-Minute R Webinar <br>(The Roadmap to a 6-Figure Data Scientist Career)</a></p>

Literally 5-years of learning, consolidated into 40-minutes. It's jammed packed with value. I wish I saw this when I was starting... It would have made a huge difference.

# Step 2: Take Control Of Your Career

For my action-takers, if you are ready to become a Business Scientist, then read on.

If you need take your skills to the next level and DON'T want to wait 5-years to learn data science for business, AND you want a career you love that earns you $100,000+ salary (plus bonuses), AND you'd like someone to help guide you how to do this in UNDER  6-MONTHS or less....

## **Then I can help with that too.**

I have a program that has helped over 3,000 students become data scientists in business with the R programming language. [Don't believe me? Read these testimonials.](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series)

My students have gotten:

* 6-Figure Data Science Jobs ($100,000+)
* Senior VP of Analytics ($200,000+)
* Lead Data Scientist Jobs ($175,000+)
* Raises and Career Promotions of 25% to 50%

All by learning data science for business with R. Get ready. The ride is wild. And the destination is AMAZING!
