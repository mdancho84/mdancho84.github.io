Your boss lives on PowerPoint decks. Do you need to create a Slide Deck every week? Let's learn how to **automate PowerPoint** with R, using `officer` and `tidyverse`.

# R-Tips Weekly Newsletter

This article is part of R-Tips Weekly, a <a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter">weekly video tutorial</a> that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks one R-tip at a time.

<p>Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡</p>

# This Tutorial Is Available In Video

I have a companion video tutorial that shows even more secrets (plus mistakes to avoid).  And, I'm finding that a lot of my students prefer the dialogue that goes along with coding. So check out this video to see me running the code in this tutorial. ðŸ‘‡

# Automate PowerPoint with R

Here's a common situation, you have to make a **Monday Morning Slide Deck**. It's the same deck each week, just date ranges for your data change. Here's how to automate this process with R!

First, here's what you need to make - **A weekly Stock Report**.

<br>

Thinking like a programmer, you can **collect your stock data using date ranges**.

With a little bit of data wrangling with the `tidyverse`, you've got your table extracted & formatted!

Then you use `timetk` to make a sweet plot.

<br>

Then you use `officer` to add the table and plot to powerpoint.

You've just **automated your Monday Morning PowerPoint in R**. BOOM! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥

# ðŸ’¡ Conclusions

You learned how to automate PowerPoint with R. Great work! **But, there's a lot more to becoming a Business Scientist (my term for an incredibly valuable data scientist that has business skills).**

If you'd like to become a Business Scientist (and have an awesome career, improve your quality of life, enjoy your job, and all the fun that comes along), then I can help with that.

## My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn how to apply data science to business. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.

I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever-increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

**If you feel like this, you're not alone.**

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. **Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught from a business perspective**
2. **Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.**

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will **get you past your struggles** and improve your career in the process.

It's my [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 8 projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment.

The result is that **you break through previous struggles**, learning from my experience & our community of 2653 data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
