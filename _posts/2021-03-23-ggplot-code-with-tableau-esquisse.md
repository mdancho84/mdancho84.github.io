Tableau-users rejoice! The `esquisse` R package is here to make you life much easier - make `ggplot2` plot code using a drag-and-drop Tableau interface. Here's what you need to do:

# How to get started with Esquisse

Esquisse is the R-package for building ggplots with a Drag-and-Drop interface. There are 3 steps to get started. 

1. Load R packages
2. Get Data
3. Run `esquisser()`

<br>

#### The `esquisser()` function fires up the ggplot builder dashboard

- Just load the dataset you want to explore
- Then drag-and-drop

<br>

#### Get the `ggplot` code

Once you are happy with your ggplot, you can get the code used to produce it!

# Learning ggplot2

`Esquisse` is awesome, but eventually you'll want to learn ggplot. **Here are a few learning tips.**

### PRO TIP 1 - Use my Cheat Sheet

I've added the `Tidyverse` to [my Ultimate R Cheatsheet](https://www.business-science.io/r-cheatsheet) (see page 1). Click the "CS" next to ggplot to get the `ggplot2` Cheat Sheet.

<br>

This downloads the "Data Visualization with ggplot2" Cheat Sheet with all of the ggplot2 functions. It's a great way to get a 1000-foot view of ggplot2. But, it can be a lot to take in.

## PRO TIP 2 - Try my Jumpstart with R Course

[Jumpstart with R](https://university.business-science.io/p/jumpstart-with-r) the 1st week of my [R-Track program](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series). You'll make a Sales Analysis with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. You'll see how several of those functions from the ggplot cheat sheet work as you make your sales analysis plots.

## In Summary

You just built `ggplot` code with drag-and-drop interface all thanks to `esquisse`!! Congratulations.

But, what if you want to build more powerful analysis and web applications?

**This could be a challenge.** You'll need to learn a ton, and this will take a long time. Plus, you might struggle and quit. 

What if there was a **program that took the guess-work out of learning data science and made it impossible to fail**?
