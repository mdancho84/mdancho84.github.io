The ___"Price Prediction App"___ is a web application empowers business people to make data-driven decisions by more consistently pricing products. The application uses ___Machine Learning___ to estimate (predict) pricing for new products based on existing products. Taking an application like this into ___Production___ in your organization ___generates ROI___ because because inconsistent pricing leads to upset customers and lower revenue.
