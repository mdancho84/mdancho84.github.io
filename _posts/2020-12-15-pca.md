This article is part of a R-Tips Weekly, a [weekly video tutorial](https://mailchi.mp/business-science/r-tips-newsletter) that shows you step-by-step how to do common R coding tasks.

<br/>

**Identify Clusters in your Data:**

We'll make an Interactive PCA visualization to investigate clusters and learn why observations are similar to each other. Here are the links to get set up. ðŸ‘‡

## PCA is all about data wrangling

PCA is a great tool for mining your data for clusters. But, most beginners get a few things wrong:

- PCA only works with numeric data
- Categorical data must be encoded as numeric data (e.g. one-hot)
- Numeric data must be scaled (otherwise your PCA will be misleading)

<br>

<center>
<p><strong>Data Wrangling is SUPER Critical</strong> <br>
We need to use <code>dplyr</code> to encode categorical features as numeric. </p>
</center>

<center>
<p><strong>Before Encoding</strong> <br>
PCA will not work with Categorical Data <br>
(You'll get a nice error message)</p>

<p><strong>After Encoding</strong> <br>
PCA likes data in this format ðŸ˜Š</p>

## Visualizing Clusters

What can we do with PCA + ggplot2? Let's visualize clusters in our data! 

<br>

<center>
    <p>First, fit a PCA using <code>prcomp()</code>.</p>
</center>

<center>
    <p>Next, use <code>autoplot()</code> from the <code>ggfortify</code> package. </p>
</center>

<br>

Then visualize. As an added bonus, we can make it interactive with `ggplotly()`!
