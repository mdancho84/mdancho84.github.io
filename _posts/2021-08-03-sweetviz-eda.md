# SweetViz: Automating EDA

Let's check out how to __automate__ an exploratory data analysis report with `SweetViz`.

</p>

## Step 1: Load Libraries and Data

First, let's load the libraries and data. From the libraries, we'll import `pandas`, `sweetviz` and my favorite plotting library, `plotnine`.

The `mpg_df` data set contains information on fuel efficiency (mpg) along with important vehicle attributes for 398 vehicles.

## Step 2: Make the SweetViz EDA Report in 2 Lines of Code

> Goal: Understand the relationship between Fuel Economy (MPG) and features in this dataset 

We can assess the relationship between vehicle fuel economy and the explanatory features using the sweetviz report. SweetViz __automates__ the process of creating the EDA report in two lines of code.

</p>

This creates the SweetViz EDA Report.

## Step 3: Investigate the Feature Correlation (Associations)

We can investigate the feature associations / correlations and see that number of cylinders (engine size), displacement (engine volume), horsepower, weight have a relationship to vehicle fuel efficiency. 

### 3A: High-Level Correlations (Associations)

We start with an overall view of the high-level relationships.



![SweetViz Correlation](/assets/2021-08-03-sweetviz/03_correlation.jpg)

- __The squares are categorical features.__ Their relationships range from 0 to 1 indicating associative strength only. We need to need to inspect tabs for categories like cylinder, which has a high associative strength to determine its effect on MPG.

- __The circles are numeric features.__ Their relationships range from -1 to 1 following a Pearson Correlation. We can see positive and negative relationships indicated by the sign (+/-) and strength of relationship (closer to +/-1 is strong, closer to zero is weak).


### 3B: Distribution Analysis: Individual Features

We can take a step further and investigate individual features to see how each relate to the target by __comparing their distributions__. 


#### Feature Tabs

For example, we can investigate "cylinders" to see how the distributions co-vary. Just click on the "cylinders" tab.

#### Exploratory Panels

This opens up an exploratory panel with useful information that __compares the distribution of vehicles by cylinder to their average MPG.__ 


![SweetViz Distribution - Cylinders](/assets/2021-08-03-sweetviz/03_cylinders_distribution.jpg)

We can see that:

- 4 Cylinder Engines: Have the highest average MPG
- 8 Cylinder Engines: Have the lowest average MPG

It's that easy to explore your dataset!

# Summary

Exploratory data analysis can be automated with the python SweetViz reporting package. SweetViz makes it fast and easy to explore features and determine relationships to a target. In our case, we saw that 4 cylinder engines have the highest average MPG while 8 cylinder engines have the lowest average MPG.
