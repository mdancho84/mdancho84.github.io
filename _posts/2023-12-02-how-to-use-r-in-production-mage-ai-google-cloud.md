# The Problem: Multi-Touch Campaign Attribution in Digital Analytics

As a digital analyst, I often need to combine data from different sources and display it in a dashboard. This is especially true when I'm working with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Ads for Campaign Attribution.

## Case Study: Digital Analytics and Multi-Touch Campaign Attribution

For instance, clients run campaigns on platforms like Google Ads and Meta Ads, and **they want to understand the impact of each channel or even individual campaigns.**

To address this, we usually:

1. Use **conversion data** from a third-party source, like Google Analytics, and 
2. Combine it with other data such as impressions, clicks, and cost from the advertising channels. 
 
This helps us **calculate the cost per conversion** for each channel more accurately.


## Building the Multi-Touch Attribution Data Engineering Pipeline

To build a data engineering pipeline, we need to factor in:

1. **Accessibility:** Make sure we can easily get data from different sources, such as Google Ads, Meta Ads, and GA4.

2. **Data integration:** Combine data from different sources accurately.

3. **Storage:** Create a data warehouse in Google BigQuery for the joined data and make it accessible to data visualization tools.

4. **Maintenance:** Find a way to automate these steps without needing manual intervention. That way stakeholders will have access to almost real-time data.

## Our Tech Stack: R, Mage.ai, Google Cloud Platform, and VSCode IDE

![How the Tools Integrate](/assets/r_mage_gcp_tool_integration.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Register for R-Tips Newsletter Here</a></p>

To build this pipeline, we'll use:

1. R: To retrieve data from the APIs and combine it.
2. Mage.ai: To automate the Extract Transform Load (ETL) process.
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): To store the data and make it accessible to data visualization tools.
4. VSCode IDE: To access the virtual machine remotely.

### 1. R: To retrieve data from the APIs and combine it

![Rstudio](/assets/069_r_logo_board.png)

- Install R here: [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)
- Access to 20,000+ of open source R packages here: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)

Packages we'll use today:

- `tidyverse`: To work with data and make the data pipeline.
- `googleAnalyticsR`: To retrieve data from the GA4 API.
- `rgoogleads`: To retrieve data from the Google Ads API.
- `bigrquery`: To export data to Google BigQuery.
- `gargle`: For Google authentication.

### 2. Mage.ai: To automate the Extract Transform Load (ETL) process

I love R and I am so thankful that [Tommy Dang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dangtommy/) and his team included it in Mage.

![Mage AI](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage_ai.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Mage AI</p>
   
- Mage.ai is a tool that helps you automate the ETL process. It's a great tool for data scientists who want to automate their data engineering pipelines.
- Mage.ai: [https://mage.ai/](https://mage.ai/)

The screenshot below comes from Mage. Mage is a data engineering tool that allows you to build your ETL (extract, transform, and load) pipelines. What I love about Mage is that it is easy to use, you can visualize your data pipelines and it supports multiple programming languages: SQL, Python.. and R!

![Mage.ai](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-ai-example.jpg)

In addition to building our pipeline, we‚Äôll use Mage to **schedule your pipelines**, as you can see in the example below.

![Mage Schedule](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-schedule.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website" target="_blank">Register for R-Tips Newsletter Here</a></p>

### 3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): To store the data and make it accessible to data visualization tools.

You can run Mage on your local machine or in the cloud.

Obviously, if you run it locally, your computer needs to be on all the time, which is not ideal. Therefore, we‚Äôll create a virtual machine (VM) on the Google Cloud Platform and run Mage from there.

A virtual machine (VM) on GCP is like a computer in the cloud. It‚Äôs not a physical machine you can touch; instead, it‚Äôs a powerful, remote computer that you can use to run your software and store your data.

![Google Cloud Platform](/assets/r_mage_gcp_google_cloud_platform.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</p>

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a cloud computing platform that allows you to store data and make it accessible to data visualization tools.
- You'll need to create a Google Cloud account to use GCP.
- Google Cloud Platform: [https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/)

To use GCP, you need a payment method. But worry not, as of today, If you have never used GCP, **you get a credit of $300**. So, go to the Google Cloud Console and create an account: [https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome).

![$300 Credits](/assets/r_mage_gcp_google-cloud-credits.jpg)

Once you have used your free credits, you need to add a credit card to your account, by going under ‚ÄúBILLING‚Äù:

![Billing](/assets/r_mage_gcp_billing.jpg)

### 4. VSCode IDE: To access the virtual machine remotely

To access the virtual machine from our computer, we‚Äôll use Visual Studio Code, which is a lovely, free code editor that supports many programming languages.

![VSCode](/assets/r_mage_gcp_vscode_ide.jpg)

# The Solution: Arben's 8-Step Framework for Data Engineering in R with Mage and GCP (in under 45 minutes)


![8-Step Framework](/assets/r_mage_gcp_8_step_framework.jpg)

<p class="date text-center">The 8 steps you follow</p>

Now for my **8-step framework** for building a data engineering pipeline in R with Mage.ai and GCP. 

- These are the steps I follow when I'm building a data engineering pipeline for a client. 
- Once you are familiar with my framework, you can build your own data engineering pipelines **in under 45 minutes.**


## Step 1: How to create a Google Cloud project

In order to use GCP, we need a project. Later, everything that we‚Äôll do will be within this project. 

So, go back to https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome and create a new project by first clicking on the project selector in the top left.

![Project Selector](/assets/r_mage_gcp_project-selector.jpg)

Then click on ‚ÄúNEW PROJECT‚Äù:

![New Project](/assets/r_mage_gcp_new-project.jpg)

Next, name your project. I called my project `mage-ai-test`.

![Project Name](/assets/r_mage_gcp_new-cloud-project.jpg)

Finally, click on ‚ÄúCREATE‚Äù. Then simply wait until your project is created. Once you have selected your project, type ‚Äúvm instances‚Äù in the search bar, and select ‚ÄúVM instances‚Äù.

![VM Instances](/assets/r_mage_gcp_vm-instances.jpg)

This will lead to the following screen:

![Compute Engine](/assets/r_gcp_mage_compute-engine-api.jpg)

## Step 2: How to set up a virtual machine

There are 4 sub-steps:

1. Activate the Compute Engine API's features
2. Set up SSH keys
3. Create a virtual machine
4. Connect to the virtual machine via SSH

### Step 2.1: Activate the Compute Engine API's features

On GCP, to use specific features, you must activate the corresponding APIs: 

- For example, we‚Äôll enable the Google Analytics API later to get data from GA4. 
- To make a virtual machine, we need to enable the Compute Engine API. 
- Afterward, you‚Äôll see this screen, but we won‚Äôt create a VM instance just yet‚Ä¶

![VM Instance](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-vm-instance.jpg)

### Step 2.2: Set up SSH keys

Next, we need to create SSH keys that will allow us to access our virtual machine from our computer.

SSH keys are like special keys that help your computer talk securely to another computer, such as a virtual machine.

It‚Äôs a way for your computer to prove it‚Äôs really you when connecting to the virtual machine. It‚Äôs like having a secret handshake between your computer and the virtual machine, making sure they can trust each other without needing to type in a password every time.

#### Create SSH and Public Keys

We need to create two SSH keys, a private and a public key. Think of SSH keys like a pair of magic keys for your online accounts. You have one key that you keep secret (the private key) and another key that you share with others (the public key).

1. **Private Key (Secret Key):** This is like the key to your front door that only you have. You keep it safe on your computer, and it‚Äôs a secret. It‚Äôs used to unlock and access your accounts securely.
2. **Public Key (Shared Key):** This is like a lock that matches your private key.

When you connect to a server or service, you use your private key to prove you are who you say you are. The server then checks this with your public key to make sure it‚Äôs really you. This way, even if someone gets your public key, they can‚Äôt do anything without the private key, which stays safe on your computer. It‚Äôs a bit like having a special lock and key where only your key can open it.

To create your keys, hop to the terminal in your local machine and type the following code:

``` {bash}
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/mage-ai-test -C arbenkqiku
```

The end of the code should be your username, in my case `arbenkqiku`. If you don‚Äôt know your user name, type `whoami` in the terminal and press enter. This will output your username.

Once you enter the code mentioned above, you‚Äôll be prompted to insert your computer‚Äôs password, if you have any. Once you add your password, your SSH keys will be created.

![SSH Keys](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-ssh-key.jpg)

Now, go to the directory where your SSH keys can be found. `cd` stands for ‚Äúchange directory‚Äù:

``` {bash}
cd ~/.ssh
```

This is where your public private and public SSH keys are located.

Now, type the following code to display the content of your public SSH key in the terminal.

``` {bash}
cat mage-ai-test.pub
```

This will show the content of your public SSH key that we will later paste into our VM.

![Public SSH Key](/assets/r_mage_gcp_public-key.jpg)

### Step 2.3: Create a virtual machine

Now, let‚Äôs go back to Google Cloud Platform and click on ‚ÄúCREATE INSTANCE‚Äù in the VM instances overview.

![Create Instance](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-new-vm-instance.jpg)

Give a name to the VM instance and select the region closest to you:

![VM Instance Name](/assets/r_mage_gcp_name-and-region-of-vm-instance.jpg)

Go to the ‚ÄúBoot disk‚Äù section and click on ‚ÄúCHANGE‚Äù:

![Boot Disk](/assets/r_mage_gcp_change-boot-disk.jpg)

Select the following options:

![Boot Disk Options](/assets/r_gcp_mage_advanced-boot-disk-options.jpg)

Under Firewall, select the following options:

![Firewall Options](/assets/r_gcp_mage_firewall-options.jpg)

This is important, as otherwise we won‚Äôt be able to access Mage by using the IP address of our VM, you‚Äôll understand later what I mean by this.

Under Advanced Options > Security, click on ‚ÄúADD ITEM‚Äù. Here is where we‚Äôll add our **public SSH key**.

![Add SSH Key](/assets/r_gcp_mage_add-public-key-to-vm.jpg)

Copy the entire SSH public key and paste it.

![Paste SSH Key](/assets/r_gcp_mage_paste-ssh-key.jpg)

Finally, click on ‚ÄúCREATE‚Äù. It may take some time to create the VM.

Once done, your new VM will appear here. Also, you‚Äôll see that your VM will have an ‚ÄúExternal IP‚Äù.

![External IP](/assets/r_gcp_mage_vm-external-ip.jpg)

You can use this ‚ÄúExternal IP‚Äù and your SSH private key to connect to this VM. Let‚Äôs do this!

## Step 3: How to access your virtual machine remotely

Step 3 has 2 sub-steps:

1. How to connect to your VM via SSH
2. How to connect via VSCode IDE (using Remote - SSH extension)

### Step 3.1: How to connect to your VM via SSH

Go back to the terminal in your local machine and go to the directory where the SSH keys are located:

``` {bash}
cd ~/.ssh
```

Next, type this command:

``` {bash}
ssh -i mage-ai-test arbenkqiku@34.65.231.180
```

I‚Äôll break it down to you so you know what to replace:

``` {bash}
ssh -i name_of_private_key user_name@gcp_vm_instance_external_ip
```

You‚Äôll likely will be prompted to enter your password again, and also to add the ‚ÄúExternal IP‚Äù as a host. Just follow the instructions and you should be able to connect to your VM.

As you can see from the image below, we connected to the VM named `mage-demo-test`. And if you recall, in ‚ÄúBoot disk‚Äù options, we selected Ubuntu as our operating system.

![SSH Connection](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ubuntu-vm-remote.jpg)

### Step 3.2: How to connect via VSCode IDE (using Remote - SSH extension)

We could do this whole process through the terminal, but it is much more user-friendly to do it through Visual Studio Code. 

Visual Studio Code is a very powerful code editor. Go to this link: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and download Visual Studio Code.

Once you have installed it, go to ‚ÄúExtensions‚Äù and install ‚ÄúRemote - SSH‚Äù.

![Remote SSH](/assets/r_mage_gcp_remote-ssh-code-extension.jpg)

In Visual Studio Code, go the the search bar and type >, and then select the following option:

![Remote SSH Config](/assets/r_mage_gcp_open-ssh-config.jpg)

In the configuration file that will open, you need to enter your details. Essentially, we‚Äôre providing the details to connect to our VM.

``` {bash}
Host mage-demo-test # Give a name to your host
  HostName 34.65.231.180 # Replace with the External IP address in GCP
  User arbenkqiku # Replace this with your user name
  IdentityFile /Users/arbenkqiku/.ssh/mage-ai-test # Path to private SSH key
```

Now, we still have to go back to the terminal one last time and type this:

``` {bash}
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add /Users/arbenkqiku/.ssh/mage-ai-test # Path to private SSH key
```

Then, type your password when prompted. This basically means that you can use your password when you try to access the VM through Visual Studio Code.

![SSH Agent](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ssh-add-command.jpg)

Now, go back to the search bar of Visual Studio Code, type > and select the following option:

![Remote SSH Connect](/assets/r_mage_gcp_code-connect-to-ssh-host.jpg)

It should suggest the host that you just created, click on that host:

![Choose Host](/assets/r_gcp_mage_choose-ssh-host.jpg)

Then, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter your password. Once you enter your password, you‚Äôll be connected to your VM.

![Password](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ssh-passphrase.jpg)

Now, click on the ‚ÄúRemote Explorer‚Äù icon, and it should show that you connected to your VM:

![Remote Explorer](/assets/r_mage_gcp_remote-explorer-vm.jpg)

On the top right, click this icon to display the terminal below:

![Terminal Below](/assets/r_mage_gcp_display-terminal-icon.jpg)

Now click on ‚ÄúTERMINAL‚Äù. Congratulations, you have accessed your VM through Visual Studio Code!

![Terminal](/assets/r_mage_gcp_access-terminal-success.jpg)

## Step 4: How to install Mage.ai on the virtual machine to handle the automation

To install mage on GCP, I largely followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0fNc8ZOpSI&t=696s&ab_channel=DataSlinger), but I will also explain every step here. 

Ther are mainly 3 sub-steps:

1. Create the folder for Mage
2. Install `Docker`
3. Install `Mage`
4. Access `Mage` through the External IP from GCP

### Step 4.1: Create the folder for Mage

First of all, let‚Äôs create a directory in our VM for mage:

``` {bash}
mkdir mage-demo
```

Now, if you type the following code, you should be able to see the newly created folder:

``` {bash}
ls
```

Then, let‚Äôs access the folder:

``` {bash}
cd mage-demo
```

### Step 4.2: Install `Docker`

Now, to install mage, we need to first install `Docker`.

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It uses containerization technology to package an application and its dependencies together into a single unit called a ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù.

In the `mage-demo` folder, let‚Äôs download a GitHub repo that contains the installation for Docker:

``` {bash}
git clone https://github.com/MichaelShoemaker/DockerComposeInstall.git
```

Let‚Äôs access the folder that contains the Docker installation:

``` {bash}
cd DockerComposeInstall
```

Let‚Äôs modify the file to make it executable:

``` {bash}
chmod +x InstallDocker
```

Then, let‚Äôs run it:

``` {bash}
./InstallDocker
```

Type this to verify that Docker has been installed correctly:

``` {bash}
docker run hello-world
```

This should show the following message:

![Docker Hello World](/assets/r_mage_gcp_hello-docker.jpg)

### Step 4.3: Install `Mage`

Now, let‚Äôs go back to the initial directory:

``` {bash}
cd mage-demo
```

Now, we can finally install mage with this command:

``` {bash}
docker run -it -p 6789:6789 -v $(pwd):/home/src --restart always mageai/mageai /app/run_app.sh mage start mage-ai-test
```

With the command `--restart always`, we‚Äôre asking the VM to always restart mage whenever the VM is shut down and later restarted.

At the end, `mage-ai-test` represents the name of our project.

### Step 4.4: Access `Mage` through the External IP from GCP

Now, to access mage through our External IP from GCP, we need to hop back on GCP first, as we need to create a **firewall rule**.

This is necessary to control and regulate incoming and outgoing traffic to and from your VM on Google Cloud Platform. When you want to access mage through your External IP from GCP, a firewall rule is needed to explicitly allow the traffic to reach your VM.

Browse to Firewall in the Google Cloud Platform.

Click on ‚ÄúCREATE FIREWALL RULE‚Äù:

![Create Firewall Rule](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-firewall-rule.jpg)

Select the following options and click on ‚ÄúCREATE‚Äù:

![Firewall Rule Options](/assets/r_mage_gcp_firewall-options.jpg)

Basically, with this firewall rule in place, it means we can access mage via the external IP address by using port number 6789.

Now, if you type **your VM external IP** followed by `:6789` in your web browser you should be able to access mage.

For example, this is the URL I would use with my configuration: `http://34.65.231.180:6789`.

![Mage IP Test](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-test.jpg)

As you can see, `mage-ai-test` was the name of our project in a previous command.

Congrats, now you can create data pipelines that will run in the cloud!

## Step 5: How to retrieve data from the GA4 API in a production environment

**Now, we can finally create the pipeline.** We'll first focus on retrieving data from the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) API. We will accomplish this inside of `Mage`. 

We have the following sub-steps:

1. Create a new pipeline
2. Select a Mage block tyoe (Data Loader)
3. Use R packages and code to retrieve data from the GA4 API 
4. GA4 API: How to get an access token
5. How to run GA Authentication in a production environment
6. Create a Google Analytics token
7. Test `R` Code on Your Local Machine
8. Create the full `R` Script 
9. Make JSON service account key accessible to Mage
10. Add the `R` Script to Mage

### Step 5.1: Create a new pipeline

To start, click on **New pipeline > Standard (batch)**:

![New Pipeline](/assets/r_mage_gcp_new-batch-pipeline.jpg)

On the left side, you can see all your files inside of `Mage``, even the pipeline that we have just created.

![Mage Files](/assets/r_mage_gcp_files-in-pipeline.jpg)

In the middle, you can see the blocks that you can use to build your pipelines. In this guide, we‚Äôll use **Data loader**, **Transformer**, and **Data exporter** blocks:

![Mage Blocks](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-blocks.jpg)

### Step 5.2: Select a Mage block type (Data Loader)

**The Data loader block:** As mentioned previously, you can use Python, SQL, and R in each block. In our case, we‚Äôll use `R`. So, click on Data Loader and select R:

![Data Loader](/assets/r_mage_gcp_use-r.jpg)

Name the block `ga4`, then click Save and add block. You should now see the block on the right, together with a sample R code.

![Data Loader R](/assets/r_mage_gcp_sample-r-code.jpg)

### Step 5.3: Use R packages and code to retrieve data from the GA4 API

To install and load packages, mage uses the pacman package. Once you load `pacman`, you can install packages by using:

``` {r}
pacman::p_load(package1, package2, package3)
```

‚ÄãThe first time you run the `p_load()` function, it will install a package, and then it will simply load it. For this block, we‚Äôll install three packages:

``` {r}
library("pacman")
pacman::p_load(dplyr, purrr, googleAnalyticsR)

load_data <- function() {

}
```

### Step 5.4: How to get an access token

In order to access GA4 data by using the `googleAnalyticsR` package, developed by Mark Edmondson, you need an access token.

An access token is like your digital ID card; it confirms your identity and verifies that you truly have permission to access the GA4 properties you‚Äôre attempting to retrieve data from.

To get an access token, you can run the following function in the RStudio console in your local machine: `ga_auth()`.

Once you run this function, you‚Äôll be redirected to a browser window where you‚Äôll select your account:

![GA Auth](/assets/r_mage_gcp_select-google-account.jpg)

With this, you are basically giving permission to the googleAnalyticsR package to access your GA4 properties.

**However, the problem is that we‚Äôll run our data pipeline in a production environment where you cannot interact with the browser.**

So, we need to find another way to solve this problem.

In fact, if I try to run the function `ga_auth()` on Mage, **it throws an error**:

![GA Auth Error](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ga-auth-error.jpg)

So, we need to generate a Google Analytics token that we can use in a production environment.

### Step 5.5: How to run GA Authentication in a production environment (without a browser)

#### Enable Google Analytics Reporting API

First, let‚Äôs go back to GCP and browse to Enabled APIs & services.

Click on ‚ÄúENABLE APIS AND SERVICES‚Äù.

![Enable APIs](/assets/r_mage_gcp_enable-apis-services.jpg)

Search for `Google Analytics`, click the **Google Analytics Reporting API** result, and then choose **ENABLE**.

![Enable GA API](/assets/r_mage_gcp_enable-ga-api.jpg)

This means that our project is now eligible to use the Google Analytics Reporting API.

#### Repeat steps to Enable Google Analytics Data API

Next, repeat these API-enabling steps for the **Google Analytics Data API.**

Once done, we have the APIs enabled but we still haven‚Äôt created the required token.

### Step 5.6: How to create a Google Analytics token

Browse to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) in the Google Cloud console.

Hover over ‚ÄúCREATE CREDENTIALS‚Äù and click on Service account.

![Service Account](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-service-account.jpg)

Give the service account a name and then click CREATE AND CONTINUE.

![Service Account Name](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-and-continue-service-account.jpg)

Give the service account the Editor role and then click on Continue.

![Set Editor Role](/assets/r_mage_gcp_set-editor-role.jpg)

Finally, click on **DONE**.

Now that the service account has been created, go back to the Credentials view and you‚Äôll see the account that you just created. Click on it.

![Service Account Credentials](/assets/r_mage_gcp_click-service-account-edit.jpg)

Then, click the **KEYS** tab and choose to **Create new key**.

![Create New Key](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-new-key.jpg)

Select **JSON** as the key type and click **Create**.

This should download your key as a JSON file.

**Important: Store it in a safe place.** Basically, the service account is like an account that has permission to act on your behalf. When you want your application or service to communicate with the GA4 API, it needs to prove its identity. Instead of using a user‚Äôs personal Google account, which may not be appropriate for server-to-server communication, you can use a service account.

Now, as if it were a real user, we need to go to the GA4 property and add our service account email. So, go back to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and copy your service account‚Äôs **email address**:

![Service Account Email](/assets/r_mage_gcp_copy-service-account-email.jpg)

Next, open Google Analytics 4, go to your property, and click on **Property access management** in Admin:

![Property Access Management](/assets/r_mage_gcp_property-access-management.jpg)

Add your service account email address to the list of users, give it Viewer permissions, and click on Add to add the service account as a user to the GA4 property.

### Step 5.7: Test R Code on Your Local Machine

Now, before adding code to Mage, I like to test it on my local machine to make sure that everything works properly.

So, on your local machine, open a new R script and try the following code:

``` {r}
# Packages ----
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)
library(googleAnalyticsR)

# Authenticate ----  

# path to your JSON service account that we saved earlier
ga_auth(json_file = "/Users/arbenkqiku/Desktop/mage-ai/mage-ai-test-405614-2e1e1c865c18.json")  
```

‚ÄãIf everything works correctly, you should see the following message:

![GA Auth Success](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ga-auth-test-worked.jpg)

That means that your pipeline can now communicate with the GA4 Reporting API without any extra authentication flows.

### Step 5.8: Create the R Script

Now, what I want to retrieve from GA4 are the sessions where a lead generation conversion event happened.

In the case of this client of mine, either someone submitted a form, clicked on the WhatsApp icon to talk to them privately, or clicked on the phone icon to call them.

So, in the the next piece of code I want to create a filter with all the event names I am interested in, namely the event names equal to `form_submit_lead` or `whatsapp_click` or `phone_click`.

``` {r}
# GA4 property ID
property_id = "1234567"

# Create filter
goals_filter = ga_data_filter("eventName" == "form_submit_lead" | "eventName" == "whatsapp_click" | "eventName" == "phone_click")
```

In the next piece of code, we have the actual query to GA4:

``` {r}
# Get conversions from GA4
goals_data = ga_data(propertyId = property_id,         
                     date_range = c("2023-10-01", "2023-11-08"),        
                     dimensions = c("date"),        
                     metrics = c("sessions"),        
                     dim_filter = goals_filter) %>%     

# rename sessions to goals
set_names(c("date", "goals"))
```

Basically, we‚Äôre getting the sessions from 1st October 2023 until 8th November 2023, segmented by date, and only when one of the events mentioned earlier occurred. 

This is what the final table looks like in my case:

![GA4 Data](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ga-table-results.jpg)

It is not always easy to know what certain fields are called in the GA4 API. You can go to [this website](https://ga-dev-tools.google/ga4/dimensions-metrics-explorer/) and look for a specific field. For example, if we look for ‚Äúchannel‚Äù, you can see all the different fields that contain ‚Äúchannel‚Äù and what they are called in the GA4 API.

![GA4 API Fields](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ga-explorer-dims.jpg)

Now, in addition to retrieving the sessions where a conversion event occurred, I also want to retrieve the sessions segmented by day, so I‚Äôll use this query:

``` {r}
# Get sessions from GA4
sessions_data = ga_data(
    propertyId = property_id,                      
    date_range = c("2023-10-01", "2023-11-08"),        
    dimensions = c("date"),                     
    metrics = c("sessions")
)
```

This returns a table of sessions segmented by date.

Now, to join the sessions with the conversions:

``` {r}
# Merge GA4 goals and sessions
sessions_goals_ga4 = sessions_data %>%   
	# join sessions with goals  
    full_join(goals_data) %>%   
	# replace all NAs with 0  
    replace(is.na(.), 0)
```

This is the final result:

![GA4 Goals and Sessions](/assets/r_mage_gcp_sessions-by-goals.jpg)

**Here is the complete code.** At the end of the script, I added the `sessions_goals_ga4` dataframe. This is because in Mage, we‚Äôre using this code within a Data Loader block. We need to return a dataframe for the next block, otherwise the next block doesn‚Äôt have any data to play with.

``` {r}
# Packages ----
library(purrr)
library(dplyr)
library(googleAnalyticsR)

# Authenticate ----  
	# path to your JSON service account that we save earlier
ga_auth(json_file = "/Users/arbenkqiku/Desktop/mage-ai/mage-ai-test-405614-2e1e1c865c18.json")  

# GA4 property ID
property_id = "1234567"

# Create filter
goals_filter = ga_data_filter("eventName" == "form_submit_lead" | "eventName" == "whatsapp_click" | "eventName" == "phone_click")

# Get conversions from GA4
goals_data = ga_data(propertyId = property_id,         
                     date_range = c("2023-10-01", "2023-11-08"),        
                     dimensions = c("date"),        
                     metrics = c("sessions"),        
                     dim_filter = goals_filter) %>%     

	# rename sessions to goals
set_names(c("date", "goals"))

# Get sessions from GA4
sessions_data = ga_data(propertyId = property_id,                      
                        date_range = c("2023-10-01", "2023-11-08"),        
                        dimensions = c("date"),                     
                        metrics = c("sessions"))

# Merge GA4 goals and sessions
sessions_goals_ga4 = sessions_data %>%   
	# join sessions with goals  
full_join(goals_data) %>%   
	# replace all NAs with 0  
replace(is.na(.), 0)

# Final data frame for next block in mage.ai
sessions_goals_ga4
```

### Step 5.9: Make JSON service account key accessible to Mage

Now, before we copy this code to Mage, we need to make our JSON service account key accessible to Mage, as for now it is only available on our local machine.

Remember, Mage is installed on our virtual machine. We need to paste the JSON service account key there.

Open Visual Studio Code and click on ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù.

![Open VSCode](/assets/r_mage_gcp_visual-studio-code-open.jpg)

Go to the path where your JSON service account key is located in your local machine. You should be able to see your service account key in the left panel.

![Copy JSON Path](/assets/r_mage_gcp_vs-code-json-path.jpg)

Right-click and copy it.

Next, go to the search bar, type > and connect to your virtual machine.

![Connect to VM](/assets/r_mage_gcp_connect-to-vm.jpg)


Once you are in the VM, click on ‚ÄúOpen‚Ä¶‚Äù and access the folder where Mage is installed. Click on ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.

![Open Mage Folder](/assets/r_mage_gcp_open-file-folder.jpg)

On the left side you should now see the files contained in that folder.

Right-click in that area and choose **Paste** to paste your service account JSON file into the project.

You should see your service account file now successfully added to the files in your VM.

![Paste JSON](/assets/r_mage_gcp_service-account-in-vm.jpg)

In Mage, you can use the function `list.files()` to see that the service account key is available.

![List Files](/assets/r_mage_gcp_service-account-key-available.jpg)

### Step 5.10: Add the R Script to Mage

Now, take the code that we previously played with in RStudio and paste it into Mage. You need to make some adjustments, though.

The main change is that the bulk of the code is now within the `load_data()` function. The only code that‚Äôs run outside that function are the library loads.

Another thing that changes is the path to the service account key. This now needs to reference the path to the file in your VM. As it should be in the root of your project, you just need to add the filename.

``` {r}
library("pacman")
pacman::p_load(dplyr, purrr, googleAnalyticsR)

load_data <- function() {
    # Specify your data loading logic here
    # Return value: loaded dataframe

    # Retrieve data ----
    # path to your JSON service account
    ga_auth(json_file = "mage-ai-test-405614-2e1e1c865c18.json")

    # GA4 property ID
    property_id = "1234567"

    # Create filter
    goals_filter = ga_data_filter("eventName" == "form_submit_lead" | "eventName" == "whatsapp_click" | "eventName" == "phone_click")

    # Get conversions from GA4
    goals_data = ga_data(propertyId = property_id, 
                         date_range = c("2023-10-01", "2023-11-08"),
                         dimensions = c("date"),
                         metrics = c("sessions"),
                         dim_filter = goals_filter,
    ) %>% 
    
    set_names(c("date", "goals"))

    # Get sessions from GA4
    sessions_data = ga_data(propertyId = property_id, 
                            date_range = c("2023-10-01", "2023-11-08"),
                            dimensions = c("date"),
                            metrics = c("sessions"))

    # Merge GA4 goals and sessions
    sessions_goals_ga4 = sessions_data %>% 
    # join sessions with goals
    full_join(goals_data) %>% 
    # replace all NAs with 0
    replace(is.na(.), 0)

    # Final data frame
    sessions_goals_ga4
}
```

If everything worked properly, Mage will provide a preview of the data retrieved:

![Preview Data](/assets/r_mage_gcp_image-preview.jpg)

As you can see, our Data loader block has a green tick next to it, which means that it was able to run successfully.

![Data Loader Success](/assets/r_mage_gcp_data-loader-worked.jpg)

Later, we can use this data that we retrieved from GA4 for whatever purpose we want. However, before playing around with it, let‚Äôs download some data from Google Ads!

## Step 6: How to retrieve data from the Google Ads API in a production environment

To retrieve data from the Google Ads API, we‚Äôll use the R package `rgoogleads`, developed by Alexey Seleznev. Unfortunately, with this package it is not possible to use a service account key. 

Instead, we‚Äôll have to generate an access token by using the `gargle` package. The goal of `gargle`, as explained on their website, is to ‚Äútake some of the agonizing pain out of working with Google APIs‚Äù.

This step has 4 sub-steps:

1. Get an access token
2. Test the access token locally
3. Retrieve Google Ads API data into our production environment

### Step 6.1: How to get an access token

First of all, you need to browse to the [Google Ads API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/googleads.googleapis.com) in Google Cloud Platform and click to Enable it.

So, when we attempt to fetch our Google Ads data, Google asks for our permission to let this app access our ads data. If we say yes, Google gives us an access token. This token then lets our computer talk to the Google Ads API without having to interact each time.

Before doing anything, GCP will ask you to set up a ‚Äúconsent screen‚Äù. This screen is like a friendly message to users, letting them know that our app wants to look at their Google Ads data.

It‚Äôs a way to make sure users are aware and agree to let our app access their information. To get started, browse to the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) section of your GCP project.

Here, click on ‚ÄúCONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN‚Äù.

![Configure Consent Screen](/assets/r_mage_gcp_configure-consent-screen.jpg)

Select **External** as the User Type and then click ‚ÄúCREATE‚Äù.

Give your app a name and add your email address.

![App Name](/assets/r_mage_gcp_name-and-email-consent.jpg)

Add your email to the **Developer email address**, too, and then click ‚ÄúSAVE AND CONTINUE‚Äù.

In the next screen, click on ‚ÄúADD OR REMOVE SCOPES‚Äù. Scopes govern what your app is allowed to do with the APIs.

Search for google ads and select the **Google Ads API**. Click UPDATE when done.

![Google Ads API](/assets/r_mage_gcp_add-google-ads-scope.jpg)

Then, click ‚ÄúSAVE AND CONTINUE‚Äù to proceed to the ‚ÄúTest users‚Äù step.

Here, click ‚ÄúADD USERS‚Äù. Add your email address and click ‚ÄúADD‚Äù.

![Test Users](/assets/r_mage_gcp_add-test-user.jpg)

Make sure to include your email because our app is currently in the ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù phase. During this phase, only the emails that are added can be used by the app. So, adding your email is crucial to get your Google Ads data.

Click on ‚ÄúSAVE AND CONTINUE‚Äù to proceed to the Summary step, and then ‚ÄúBACK TO DASHBOARD‚Äù when done with configuring the consent screen.

Now that the consent screen has been configured, you can browse to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) again.

Here, click on ‚ÄúCREATE CREDENTIALS‚Äù and this time choose OAuth client ID.

![OAuth Client ID](/assets/r_mage_gcp_oauth-client-id.jpg)

Under **Application type**, select **Desktop app**, give a name to your OAuth client ID, and click on ‚ÄúCREATE‚Äù:

![OAuth Client ID Name](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-oauth-id.jpg)

Download your client ID as a JSON file and click on OK.

![Download JSON](/assets/r_mage_gcp_download-oauth-json.jpg)

Save it in a secure location. 

### Step 6.2: How to test the access token locally

Now, let‚Äôs go back to `RStudio` or `VSCode` on our local machine. Open a new script and load these packages:

``` {r}
# Packages
library(gargle)
library(rgoogleads)
```

Then, we‚Äôll import the OAuth Client ID credentials that we just created by using the function `gargle_oauth_client_from_json()`. The name of your client can be whatever you prefer:

``` {r}
# Create gargle client
my_client = gargle_oauth_client_from_json(
    path = "/Users/arbenkqiku/Desktop/mage-ai/mage-demo-client-id.json",
    name = "Google Ads App"
)
```

Then, we can add the following scope and email to our token request:

``` {r}
scopes = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords"
email = "arben.kqiku@gmail.com"
```

‚ÄãFinally, we can go through the process of acquiring a token by running this function:
    
``` {r}
# Create a token by using Gargle
my_token = gargle2.0_token(
    email = email,  
    package = "rgoogleads",  
    scope = scopes,  
    client = my_client
)
```

This will open a browser window.

Do you recognize the name of the App? That‚Äôs the name of our application! We‚Äôre now going through the process of authorizing our app to access our Google Ads data. Now, select your email.

![Select Email](/assets/r_mage_gcp_authorize-app.jpg)

Google will tell you that this app isn‚Äôt verified, as its status is still ‚Äútesting‚Äù.

However, it is our own app, so we can safely click on ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù.

Authorize the app to ‚ÄúSee, edit, create and delete your Google Ads accounts and data‚Ä¶‚Äù and click on ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù.

![Authorize App](/assets/r_mage_gcp_authorize-google-ads-access.jpg)

If everything worked correctly, you should see a message saying, "Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R."

Now, if we review the content of the variable `my_token`, which contains our access token, we can review the information again, for example the email associated with the token, the scopes, and so forth.

![Token Info](/assets/r_mage_gcp_review-token.jpg)

We can now test if the token works properly by running the `gads_auth()` function. Nothing should really happen here, as with the token we can authenticate non-interactively.

``` {r}
# Authenticate by using the previously created token
gads_auth(token = my_token)
```

Let‚Äôs run a simple function of the `rgoogleads` package to see if we can access our data:

``` {r}
# get list of accessible accounts
gads_get_accessible_customers()
```

Yes, I am able to retrieve the accounts that I have access to!

![Accessible Accounts](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ads-accounts-listed.jpg)

However, we are not ready for production yet. In fact, if we type this code:

``` {r}
# where is the cache of the token located
my_token$cache_path
```

We‚Äôll get the result that the token is cached in a local directory, such as `~/Library/Caches/gargle`.

This means that when we try to load `my_token` in production, it will look for the local path instead of a path on the VM.

So, we need to change the cache path to our Mage directory on the VM. This is how you‚Äôd do it:

``` {r}
# change path of cache to mage main directory
my_token$cache_path = "/home/src"

# save token again with changed directory
saveRDS(my_token, file = "google_ads_token_mage_demo.RDS")
```

Here is the full code to generate, test, and save the token:

``` {r}
# Packages
library(gargle)
library(rgoogleads)

# Create gargle client
my_client = gargle_oauth_client_from_json(path = "/Users/arbenkqiku/Desktop/mage-ai/mage-demo-client-id.json",
                                          name = "Google Ads App")

# Define scope and email
scopes = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords"
email = "arben.kqiku@gmail.com"

# Create a token by using Gargle
my_token = gargle2.0_token(email = email,  
                           package = "rgoogleads",  
                           scope = scopes,  
                           client = my_client)

# Authenticate by using the previously created token
gads_auth(token = my_token)

# Test token by getting the list of accessible accounts
gads_get_accessible_customers()

# Change path of cache to mage main directory, so you can use the token in production
my_token$cache_path = "/home/src"

# Save token with changed directory
saveRDS(my_token, file = "google_ads_token_mage_demo.RDS")
```

### Step 6.3: How to retrieve data from the Google Ads API in a production environment

Now that we have generated the access token, you can copy-paste the JSON file from your local machine to the VM directory by using Visual Studio Code. Follow the exact steps you took to copy-paste the service account JSON file before.

Next, we can go back to Mage, add a Data loader block, and select R as the programming language.

![Data Loader](/assets/r_mage_gcp_new-data-loader-with-r.jpg)

Name the block `google_ads` and click on ‚ÄúSave and add block‚Äù.

In the block code, we need to first load the necessary packages.

``` {r}
library("pacman")
p_load(rgoogleads)
p_load(dplyr)
p_load(purrr)

load_data <- function() {

}
```

Then, we need to load our access token, authenticate with it, and set the Google Ads account ID we want to get the data from.

``` {r}
# load Google Ads access token
my_token = readRDS(file = "google_ads_token_mage_demo.RDS")
    
# Authenticate with the token
gads_auth(token = my_token)

# Set the Google Ads account id you want to get data from
gads_set_customer_id('123-123-1234')
```

Here is the query that we‚Äôre using to retrieve our data. We‚Äôll retrieve impressions, clicks, and cost segmented by date, from ‚Äú2023-10-19‚Äù until ‚Äú2023-11-01‚Äù.

``` {r}
# run query
google_ads_account_data = gads_get_report(
  resource    = "customer",
  fields      = c("segments.date",
                  "metrics.impressions",
                  "metrics.clicks",
                  "metrics.cost_micros"),
  date_from   = "2023-10-19",
  date_to     = "2023-11-01"
)
```

The first argument you need to define is the resource you are getting the data from, in our case `customer`.

You can find [here](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v13/overview#list-of-all-resources) the list of all available resources.

For example, if you would like to retrieve data at the ad group level, you should define the resource as `ad_group`.

To build our query, we can use the [Google Ads query builder](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v13/customer_query_builder), which can be used for any resource, in our case `customer`.

![Google Ads Query Builder](/assets/r_mage_gcp_build-customer-query.jpg)

Below you can select attributes, segments, or metrics:

![Google Ads Query Builder](/assets/r_mage_gcp_select-attributes-segments-metrics.jpg)

When you select fields, it will start populating the query in the user interface of the builder.

This is very useful to know what the metrics and dimensions are called in the Google Ads API.

Here is the final part of our Data loader block, which should always be a variable containing data, as we have to pass something to the next block.

``` {r}
# return data
google_ads_account_data
```

Here is the complete code block we‚Äôre working with:

``` {r}
library("pacman")
p_load(rgoogleads)
p_load(dplyr)
p_load(purrr)

load_data <- function() {
    # Specify your data loading logic here
    # Return value: loaded dataframe
    
    # load Google Ads access token
    my_token = readRDS(file = "google_ads_token_mage_demo.RDS")
    
    # Authenticate with the token
    gads_auth(token = my_token)
    
    # Set the Google Ads account id you want to get data from
    gads_set_customer_id('123-123-1234')

    # run query
    google_ads_account_data = gads_get_report(
      resource    = "customer",
      fields      = c("segments.date",
                      "metrics.impressions",
                      "metrics.clicks",
                      "metrics.cost_micros"),
      date_from   = "2023-10-19",
      date_to     = "2023-11-01"
    )

# return data for next block
google_ads_account_data
}
```

If you run this code, you should be able to see clicks, cost, and impressions segmented by date.

![Google Ads Data](/assets/r_mage_gcp_ads-data-table.jpg)

We‚Äôre now done with this Data Loader block. Next, let‚Äôs move on to **transformers**.



## Step 7: How to join and export data to Google BigQuery in a production environment

This step has 2 sub-steps:

1. Join the data from GA4 and Google Ads with a Transformer block
2. Export the data to Google BigQuery with a Data Exporter block

### Step 7.1: Join the data from GA4 and Google Ads with a Transformer block

In Mage, add a new **Transformer** block and select **R** as the programming language.

Give the block a name like `join_ga4_google_ads` and click on ‚ÄúSave and add block‚Äù.

In the Tree, we can now see that the Transformer block named `join_ga4_google_ads` only receives data from the Data Loader block `google_ads`. We need to also link the Data Loader `ga4` with the Transformer.

To do this, you simply need to drag and drop the arrow from the `ga4` block to the `join_ga4_google_ads` Transformer.

![Join Data](/assets/r_mage_gcp_join-ga4-transformer.jpg)

The first thing that we‚Äôll do in the Transformer block is to add the final variables from the previous Data loader blocks to the `transform()` function.

![Add Variables](/assets/r_mage_gcp_transform-data-loader-functions.jpg)

Next, we can add the following packages on top of the `transform()` function:

``` {r}
library("pacman")
p_load(tibble, dplyr, purrr, stringr, lubridate)
```

The first piece of code that we‚Äôre adding is this:

``` {r}
# Build a row with the exact time
check_time = tibble(
    Date = Sys.time(),
    Impressions = 0,
    Sessions = 0,
    Clicks = 0,
    Cost = 0,
    Goals = 0
)
```

I am creating this tibble called `check_time` only so that later in BigQuery we can verify whether our schedule from Mage is working correctly.

Then, we can finally join the Google Ads data with the GA4 data, and also return the `merged_data` variable for the next block:

``` {r}
# Merge Google Ads with GA4 Data
merged_data = google_ads_account_data %>%
  
  left_join(sessions_goals_ga4, by = c("date" = "date")) %>%
  
  # reorder and capitalise columns
  select(date, impressions, sessions, clicks, cost, goals) %>% 
  set_names(names(.) %>% str_to_title()) %>%
  
  # add check_time variable to verify schedule
  mutate(Date = Date %>% as_datetime()) %>%
  bind_rows(check_time) %>%

  # replace NAs with 0
  replace(is.na(.), 0) %>%
  
  arrange(desc(Date))

# Return merged_data variable for next block
merged_data
```

If everything worked properly, you should get something similar to this:

I am aware that we‚Äôre joining Google Ads data with GA4 data from all sources, and we should actually only join GA4 data coming from Google Ads. However, the goal of this guide is simply to show how to perform data engineering tasks with digital data.

### Step 7.2: Export the data to Google BigQuery with a Data Exporter block

Now that we joined data successfully from Google Ads and GA4, we‚Äôre ready to export the data to BigQuery.

Browse to the [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/) in your Google Cloud Platform project.

BigQuery has the following data hierarchy: **project -> dataset -> table.**

We already have a project, so now we need to create a dataset where our tables will reside. Click on the three dots on the right of your project, and then on ‚ÄúCreate data set‚Äù:

![Create Dataset](/assets/r_mage_gcp_create-bq-dataset.jpg)

Give a name to your data set, select a region, and click on ‚ÄúCREATE DATA SET‚Äù:

![Dataset Name](/assets/r_mage_gcp_configure-bq-dataset.jpg)

Back in Mage, add a **Data Explorer** block and choose **R** as the programming language again.

Name the block `biq_query_export` and click on ‚ÄúSave and add block‚Äù.

This is what your data tree should look like.

![Data Tree](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-data-tree.jpg)

Go the the `big_query_export` block, and add `merged_data` as the argument of the function `export_data()`. Also, let‚Äôs load the `bigrquery` package.

``` {r}
library("pacman")
p_load(bigrquery)

export_data <- function(merged_data) {
    # Specify your data exporting logic here
    # Return value: exported dataframe
    
}
```

To authenticate with BigQuery, we can actually use the service account key that we previously created for GA4.

The only thing that changes is the function `bq_auth()` instead of `ga_auth()`.

This is great news as it means we don‚Äôt have to go through yet another cumbersome authentication process:

``` {r}
# Authenticate
bq_auth(path = "mage-ai-test-405614-2e1e1c865c18.json")
```

In fact, you can use the same service account key to authenticate with multiple Google services such as Google Drive or Google Sheets.

There are different R packages for these services, such as `googledrive` and `googlesheets4`.

Granted, you need to authorize the respective APIs in the Google Cloud Platform as shown previously, but this is a great time saver!

The next thing to do is to create a table reference for BigQuery.

As you may remember, we previously created only a data set, so we now need to create a placeholder for our table.

To do so, we need to define our project name, data set, and table. The project name and data set are already defined and we can retrieve these from BigQuery. The table name is up to you.

``` {r}
# Define Big Query Project data
project = "mage-ai-test-405614"
data_set = "mage_demo"
table = "merged_data"

# Define table
table = bq_table(project = project, dataset = data_set, table = table)
```

To find the right project and data set name, go to BigQuery and click on the data set you created.

To the right, you should see the **Data set ID**, which comprises `project_name.data_set_name`. You can separate and copy those values to insert them into the code above.

![Data Set ID](/assets/r_mage_gcp_dataset-info.jpg)

In the following code, if the table exists, we delete and recreate it before uploading data.

I‚Äôm doing this every 5 minutes for demonstration, but in real production, I‚Äôd likely run it less frequently, adding only the new data instead of recreating the whole table.

``` {r}
if(bq_table_exists(table)){
  # if table already exists, delete it
  bq_table_delete(table)
	
	# recreate table so that we can fill it out
  bq_table_create(table, merged_data)
	
	# fill out table
  bq_table_upload(table, merged_data)
}else{
  bq_table_create(table, merged_data)
  bq_table_upload(table, merged_data)
}
```

Here is the final code:

``` {r}
library("pacman")
p_load(bigrquery)

export_data <- function(merged_data) {
    # Specify your data exporting logic here
    # Return value: exported dataframe

    # Authenticate
    bq_auth(path = "mage-ai-test-405614-2e1e1c865c18.json")

    # Define Big Query Project data
    project = "mage-ai-test-405614"
    data_set = "mage_demo"
    table = "merged_data"

    # Create table reference
    table = bq_table(project = project, dataset = data_set, table = table)

    if(bq_table_exists(table)){
      # if table already exists, delete it
      bq_table_delete(table)
	
	  # recreate table so that we can fill it out
      bq_table_create(table, merged_data)
	
	  # fill out table
      bq_table_upload(table, merged_data)
    }else{
      bq_table_create(table, merged_data)
      bq_table_upload(table, merged_data)
    }
}
```

If you run the code, you should have a new table called `merged_data` in BigQuery. If you click PREVIEW, you should be able to see data within.

Our pipeline is complete, as you can see all the blocks have a green tick:

![Pipeline Complete](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-pipeline-complete.jpg)


## Step 8: How to schedule a data pipeline that automatically updates every 5 minutes

There are 2 sub-steps:

1. Test the entire pipeline (verify it runs)
2. Create a schedule

### Step 8.1: Test the entire pipeline (verify it runs)

Only because each block ran successfully, there is no guarantee that the entire pipeline will run smoothly. So, we have to run the entire pipeline before creating a schedule.

In Mage, click on ‚ÄúTriggers‚Äù:

![Triggers](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-triggers.jpg)

At the top, click on **Run @once**.

This will produce a trigger, and you‚Äôll see that its status will change to `running`:

![Trigger Running](/assets/r_mage_gcp_trigger-running.jpg)

When done, it should say `completed` and switch to inactive state.

If we now refresh the BigQuery table, we can see that it has an updated date/time for the rows. This means that our pipeline ran successfully!

![BigQuery Table](/assets/r_mage_gcp_date-time-bigquery-updated.jpg)

### Step 8.2: Create a schedule

Now that we know that our pipeline works properly, let‚Äôs create a trigger that runs every 5 minutes.

In Mage‚Äôs Triggers view, click on **New trigger.**

Select **Schedule** as the trigger type.

![Schedule Trigger](/assets/r_mage_gcp_mage-new-schedule-trigger.jpg)

Given that the trigger will run every 5 minutes, let‚Äôs name it `every_5_minutes`.

Select custom as frequency and give the following cron expression: `*/5 * * * *`.

![Cron Expression](/assets/r_mage_gcp_every-five-minutes.jpg)

A ***cron*** expression is like a schedule for your computer tasks.

It‚Äôs a simple set of instructions that tells your system when to run a specific job.

The expression consists of five parts, representing minutes, hours, days, months, and days of the week. For example, `*/15 * * * *` means ‚Äúevery 15 minutes, every hour, every day, every month, every day of the week‚Äù.

When ready with the trigger, click on **Save changes**.

![Save Changes](/assets/r_mage_gcp_save-schedule-trigger.jpg)

Now you have created your trigger, but as you can see its status is inactive. To start it, click on **Start trigger**.

![Start Trigger](/assets/r_mage_gcp_start-schedule-trigger.jpg)

The status switches to `active`. If you browse back to the Triggers view, it will show you when it‚Äôs set to trigger next.

![Next Trigger](/assets/r_mage_gcp_trigger-next-run-date.jpg)

Be mindful of the fact that the time zone in Mage is in UTC.

Once the timer is set to go off, its status should change to `running`.

After it‚Äôs run, you can now refresh the BigQuery table and see that the data has now been updated again.
