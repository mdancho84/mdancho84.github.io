__I'm ECSTATIC ðŸ˜ƒ to announce the release of `timetk` version 2.0.0.__ This is a monumental release that significantly expands the functionality of `timetk` to go way beyond the original goals of the package. Now, the package is a full-featured time series visualization, data wrangling, and feature engineering toolkit.

- We'll first give you a little background on why `timetk` exists
- Then we'll do a short demo of what you can do with `timetk` (in 1-line of code)

If you like what you see, I have an [Advanced Time Series Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting) where you will learn High-Performance Time Series Analysis and Forecasting.

# Why timetk for time series? 

I'll go into detail about [what you can do in 1-line of code](#single-line-of-code), and I have several more articles on how to use a [forecasting tool called Modeltime](/code-tools/2020/06/29/introducing-modeltime.html)... __But, first a little history.__

## Fixing the inconsistency problem

Time series has been a passion project for me since my days of forecasting sales and economic data for a manufacturing company I worked for. My one gripe has always been that I had to use 50 different packages (`zoo`, `xts`, `dplyr`, etc) made by 50 different people to perform common data wrangling and visualization analyses. `timetk` solves this problem by making a consistent approach to visualize, wrangle, and preprocess time series data inside the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` ecosystem. 

With advancements in tidy-time series, the combination of the `tidyverse` and time series is an amazingly powerful concept. I'm not the first one to think of this idea. In fact, Davis Vaughan created `tibbletime` and the "tidyverts" (Rob Hyndman, Earo Wang, and Mitchell O'Hara-Wild) have created a whole forecasting and data wrangling system using a `tsibble` data structure. 

These are amazing packages, but they solve different needs. `tibbletime` focused on data wrangling. The `tidyverts` focused on forecasting at scale using ARIMA.

## The timetk difference

<div class="pull-right hidden-xs" style="width:50%; margin-left:20px;">
  <a href="#" target="_blank">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/2020-06-05-timetk/timetk_version_2.jpg"> 
  </a>
  <p class="date text-center">Visualize, wrangle, and preprocess time series data</p>
</div>

Timetk is different. It's designed for:

- __Quick interactive visualizations__ for easy data exploration
- __Time series data wrangling transformations__ for doing time series summarization, filtering, padding, and simple date-based arithmetic inside the `tidyverse` 
- __Feature engineering and preprocessing__ that work in the `tidymodels` ecosystem so we can do [_Time Series Machine Learning with Modeltime_](/code-tools/2020/06/29/introducing-modeltime.html)

So I created `timetk` version 2.0.0 to solve these needs. 




# The timetk mission

Here's the new _mission_, and what you can do _in 1-line of code_ with `timetk` >= 2.0.0:

> <span style="color:blue;">To make it easy to __visualize, wrangle, and feature engineer time series data__ for forecasting and machine learning prediction. </span>

# Time Series Visualization <br><small>What can you do in one-line of Code?</small> {#single-line-of-code}

First step, load these R packages.


{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(timetk)
{% endhighlight %}

### 1. Investigate a time series

This is fun! In 1 line of code we can visualize a dataset. 


{% highlight r %}
# Static ggplot
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_time_series(date, value, .color_var = week(date),
                     .interactive = FALSE, .color_lab = "Week")
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](/figure/source/2020-06-05-timetk-vesion-2-announcement/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)

__So what did we just do?__

We are exploring `taylor_30_min`, which is a classic electricity-demand time series that comes from one of my all-time-favorite packages, `forecast`. It's been updated to the `tibble` structure with a time stamp column called "date" and a value column called "value". 

We can plotted it using `plot_time_series()`. I set `.interactive = FALSE` to return a `ggplot` (I'll do that for all of the visualizations in this tutorial). The default is to return an interactive `plotly` graph, which is great for `shiny` apps, `rmarkdown` HTML documents, and super powerful for exploring time series (zooming, panning, etc). 

__Want the an interactive `plotly` visualization?__ 

Just try this code and explore the `plotly` visualization.


{% highlight r %}
# INTERACTIVE Plotly
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_time_series(date, value, .color_var = week(date),
                     .interactive = TRUE, .plotly_slider = TRUE, .color_lab = "Week")
{% endhighlight %}

Let's pick up the pace. Here's some more amazing visualization capabilities!

### 2. Visualize anomalies

We can visualize anomalies for multiple time series groups. Here we use `group_by()` to group the time series. Note this is a different dataset, `walmart_sales_weekly`.


{% highlight r %}
walmart_sales_weekly %>%
    group_by(Store, Dept) %>%
    plot_anomaly_diagnostics(Date, Weekly_Sales, 
                             .facet_ncol = 3, .interactive = FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](/figure/source/2020-06-05-timetk-vesion-2-announcement/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

### 3. Make a seasonality plot

We can get seasonality plots. 


{% highlight r %}
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_seasonal_diagnostics(date, value, .interactive = FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](/figure/source/2020-06-05-timetk-vesion-2-announcement/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

### 4. Inspect autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation (and cross correlations too)

And we can search the Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation. 


{% highlight r %}
taylor_30_min %>%
    plot_acf_diagnostics(date, value, .lags = "1 week", .interactive = FALSE)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](/figure/source/2020-06-05-timetk-vesion-2-announcement/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)




## Learning More

Like `timetk` for time series? We just scratched the surface. Believe me, [the timetk API is extensive.](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/reference/index.html) 

So how are you ever going to __learn time series analysis and forecasting?__ You're probably thinking:

- There's so much to learn
- My time is precious
- I'll never learn time series

I have good news that will put those doubts behind you. 

You can learn time series analysis and forecasting in hours with my [state-of-the-art time series forecasting course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting/). ðŸ‘‡
