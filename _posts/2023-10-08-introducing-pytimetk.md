Hey guys, welcome back to my [R-tips newsletter](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website). I'm deviating from the normal R post to talk about a **new Python package** (available on my [Python Newsletter](https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter?el=website)). Sounds weird, but it's actually aimed at helping R users do time series analysis in Python. It's a port of my R package `timetk` thats been downloaded over 2,000,000 times. And I'm excited to announce it's available in Python. Let's go! 

### Table of Contents

Today, I'm focusing on a Financial Time Series Analysis use case. Here's what we'll cover:

* **Why Pytimetk for Time Series Analysis in Python?**

* **Fast Experimentation (Part 1): Adding 3 Moving Averages and 3 Moving Medians to 6 Stocks**

* **BONUS: Fast Experimentation (Part 2): Adding Customized Bollinger Bands to 6 Stocks**

* **Special Announcement: [Free LIVE Python Time Series for Finance Workshop on October 17th](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1716838099992/WN_QKYacsmkSryYuYvyUXkW9g)**

# Python-Tips Newsletter

This article is part of Python-Tips, a <a href="https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter?el=website">bi-weekly tutorial</a> that shows you step-by-step how to do common python coding tasks.

<p>Here are the links to get set up. üëá</p>

# Why Pytimetk for Time Series Analysis in Python?

It's no question that Python is a powerful language for algorithmic trading, quantitative analysis, and finance. But when it comes to doing time series analysis, Python and more specifically `pandas` takes a lot of code to do simple things at scale. And `pandas` is slow. Plus it's easy to mess things up. 

Both Jason Strimpel (of PyQuant News and Co-Founder Quant Science) and I (Matt Dancho, Founder of Business Science, Co-Founder Quant Science) have been working in Time Series and Financial Analysis for a combined 40 years, and over that time we've created, well, *a lot* of software (that's an understatement).

With the rise in Python for data science and machine learning, it's now time to take some of our foundational algorithms and time series toolkits and open source them to make things just a little bit easier **(and to give you access to the same tools the PROS use).**

# Enter Pytimetk.

[Pytimetk is brand new](https://business-science.github.io/pytimetk/), and it's our first joint software development initiative at Quant Science and Business Science (our sister company).

![Pytimetk](/assets/pytimetk_website.jpg)

<p class="date text-center"><a href="https://business-science.github.io/pytimetk/" target="_blank">Pytimetk Website</a></p>

Users of the `R` programming language will recognize the name `timetk`. It's a time series toolkit that I created in 2018 that has been downloaded over 2,000,000 times. And it's been central to my time series forecasting ecoystem, namely `modeltime`.

# The goal of `pytimetk` is to make Time Series Analysis in Python easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

The goal of `pytimetk` is to make Time Series Analysis in Python easier, faster, and more enjoyable. And believe me when I say this... We have A LOT COMING for both Time Series and Financial Analysis. And we want to SHARE it with you!

In fact, Jason and I (Matt) have an upcoming **LIVE Workshop with Special Guest Snowflake** (THE BIGGEST company in Financial Data Science). Jonathan Regenstein, Director of Financial Services Data Science at Snowflake is our Special Guest. Inside the workshop, we will uncover how Snowflake is using pytimetk to scale financial workloads inside their infrastructure. PLUS we'll share the full roadmap for software development and our Quant Science courses at the event. [**Register here for Python Time Series for Finance with Pytimetk (Special Guest: Snowflake).**](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/1716838099992/WN_QKYacsmkSryYuYvyUXkW9g)

We have 2 brief examples to share today that focuses on fast experimentation. And please attend the workshop to see a more in-depth finance tutorial.

# Fast Experimentation (Part 1): Adding 3 Moving Averages and 3 Moving Medians to 6 Stocks

The first thing to do is to install pytimetk into your Quant Stack. Our official quant stack contains python packages like openbb, alphalens, pyfolio. And pytimetk fits right in.

## `Pytimetk` Installation

Because we are under active development, it's best to install the Development Version of Pytimetk. You can do so here.

```{python}
pip install git+https://github.com/business-science/pytimetk.git
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest stable version from PyPI.

```{python}
pip install pytimetk
```

## Import the packages and get the dataset

Next, here's how we recommend to `import pytimetk as tk`. This gets you access to all of the rich functionality that we are about to cover.

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter?el=website' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

## Glimpse the Data Set

Our first function I'd like to introduce you to is `tk.glimpse()`. This function allows us to quickly see what columns we have in our dataset, the data class for each column, and what the data looks like for the first several observations. If you come from the R programming language, you'll notice an immediate parallel to the `tidyverse`.

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter?el=website' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

## Fast Experimentation: Adding 3 Moving Averages and 3 Moving Medians to 6 Stocks

> As Jason Strimpel says, *"The best traders have market intuition"*.

One of the best ways to get market intuition is to do Fast Experimentation. Develop and idea (or strategy), test it, and iterate. This is where `pytimetk` excels. Let's take a quick example.

## Augmenting Rolling Features

Here let's use a new function called `tk.augment_rolling()` to add MANY rolling time series features. This is great for simple moving averages, moving standard deviations, and more.

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter?el=website' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

Next, `tk.glimpse()` the data to see what happened. 

![Glimpse](/assets/QS005_04_glimpse.jpg)

We now have 6 new features to explore. Not bad for 3 lines of code. Most importantly these 6 features have been added by group. Pytimetk respects Pandas' `groupby` method.

## Data Visualization with Plot Time Series

In our fast experimentation, a key component is visualization. For that we have `tk.plot_timeseries()`. Run the following code to convert the moving averages to long format and visualize with `plot_timeseries`:

1. Plot time series uses long-format, this is also a convention from R's `tidyverse` that makes complex faceted plots possible. 
2. To get into long format, we add a `melt` function to get the columns we want to compare into long format. 
3. Then `groupby` and `plot_timeseries`.

![Plot time series](/assets/QS005_05_visualize.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter?el=website' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

This produces the following interactive plotly visualization.

![Plot Time Series](/assets/QS005_plot_1.png)

**Key Point:** You can easily scale this to as many time series as needed to explore vast ecosystems of stocks (and even entire indexes).

## Moving Medians

Next, let's add moving medians. This is as simple as changing the `stat` argument to `median` and the `col_name` argument to `median`.

![Moving Medians](/assets/QS005_06_moving_medians.jpg)

<p class='text-center date'> <a href='https://learn.business-science.io/python-tips-newsletter?el=website' target ='_blank'><strong>Get the Code.</strong></a> </p>

Then just update the visualization:

## BONUS: Fast Experimentation (Part 2): Adding Customized Bollinger Bands to 6 Stocks

The code for this tutorial also covers how to make interactive Bollinger Band visualizations. Bollinger Bands can help you examine both trend and volatility for various stocks.
