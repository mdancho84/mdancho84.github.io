The folks at _RStudio_ have a segment on their _RViews_ blog, ["Reproducible Finance with R"](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/category/finance/), one that we at [Business Science](/index.html) are very fond of! In the spirit of reproducibility, we thought that it would be appropriate to recreate the [_RViews_ post, "Reproducible Finance with R: Sector Correlations"](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2017/01/18/reproducible-finance-with-r-sector-correlations/). This time, however, the `tidyquant` package will be used to __streamline much of the code that is currently used__. The main advantage of `tidyquant` is to bridge the gap between the best quantitative resources for collecting and manipulating quantitative data: `xts`, `zoo`, `quantmod` and `TTR`, and the data modeling workflow and infrastructure of the `tidyverse`. When implemented, `tidyquant`  __cuts the code down by about half and simplifies the workflow__.

# Correlating Sector ETF Returns to the SP500 <a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>

The folks at _RStudio_ have a new segment in _RViews_ (The _RStudio_ blog) called ["Reproducible Finance with R"](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/category/finance/). For their first installation of 2017 they looked at how Sector Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) returns correlate to the broader market using the Spider SP500 ETF ("SPY") as a proxy for the SP500 index. The _RViews_ post can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2017/01/18/reproducible-finance-with-r-sector-correlations/), and here's a snapshot of the final chart comparing the correlation between the SP500 (overall market) and the Technology ETF over time.

# Data Import  <a class="anchor" id="data-import"></a>

Alright, now is where things get interesting! Let's take a peek at the differences in how you might get data to solve this problem. 

## RViews

Here's the _RViews_ code snippet. _RViews_ created a special function to import closing prices using `getSymbols()` directly from the `quantmod` package. They then used `periodReturn()` to convert these prices to weekly log returns. Internal to the function, there are calls to `getSymbols` and `do.call` with `merge` and `lapply` twice, once to get closing prices and once to get log weekly returns. Pretty complicated. Kudos to the author, Jonathan Regenstein, at _RStudio_ for figuring this out.


{% highlight r %}
# A function to build an xts object of etf returns.
etf_weekly_returns <- function(ticker) {

    # Download prices using getSybmols    
    symbols <- getSymbols(ticker, auto.assign = TRUE, warnings = FALSE)
    # Take just the Closing prices.
    etf_prices <- do.call(merge, lapply(symbols, function(x) Cl(get(x))))
    # Use the periodReturn() function to get log weekly returns.    
    etf_returns <- do.call(merge, lapply(etf_prices, 
                                         function(x) periodReturn(x, 
                                                                  period = 'weekly',
                                                                  type = 'log')))
    
    #Change the column names to the sector names from our dataframe above.
    colnames(etf_returns) <- etf_ticker_sector$sector
        
    etf_returns

}

# Let's pass in our ticker symbols and build an xts object of etf returns
etf_returns_rviews <- etf_weekly_returns(etf_ticker_sector$ticker)

head(etf_returns_rviews)
{% endhighlight %}

## BizSci

And, the BizSci version using `tidyquant`. We first get the ETF prices using `tq_get()` and group the prices by ticker and sector. Then we use `tq_transform()` to get the period returns from the stock prices. 

If you are new to `tidyquant`, `tq_transform()` is used when the return is in a different periodicity than the input. It accepts `ohlc_fun = Cl` and `transform_fun = periodReturn` , along with any additional `periodReturn` args passed by way of `...`. This tells the function to use the closing price to calculate period returns and return the result as a new tibble. Note that typically you would used the `ohlc_fun = Ad` for period returns since stock splits are present in closing prices, but for an ETF we should not have splits.


{% highlight r %}
# Get stock prices
prices <- etf_ticker_sector %>%
    tq_get(get = "stock.prices") %>% 
    group_by(ticker, sector)

# Transform to period returns
etf_returns_bizsci <- prices %>% 
    tq_transform(ohlc_fun = Cl,  transform_fun = periodReturn, 
                 period = 'weekly', type = 'log')

head(etf_returns_bizsci)
{% endhighlight %}

{% endhighlight %}



It's that easy! No need for `do.call()`, `lapply()`, or any special functions! It's all been taken care of for you. Grouping by ticker (and sector to keep the column) allows us to perform the transform on __each group__ separately, but with one line of code. Also, notice that the data is preserved in a _tidy_ format, as opposed to the xts format that _RViews_ uses. 

Additionally, _RViews_ intends to create a flexdashboard from their notebook:

> ...this Notebook will be the first step toward an flexdashboard that lets us do more interactive exploration – choosing different sector ETFs and rolling windows
> 
> -Jonathan Regenstein, RStudio

It would be easy to now create a function wrapping the process like _RViews_ did, allowing the user to just enter the tibble of tickers. This could be useful in the flexdashboard that they will create, but for this post, we chose not do to that.


# Rolling Correlations <a class="anchor" id="rolling-corr"></a>

The next step is to calculate _rolling correlations_ between the SP500 index ("SPY") ETF returns and the sector-specific ETF returns. 

## RViews

Here's how _RViews_ solved this problem in two steps.

##### Step 1: Create a Sector Index Correlation Function

A function is a nice approach, but the downside is it only works for one component unless you use the `purrr` package to map the function. A special function was again created to merge the sector and SPY returns and then apply the rolling correlation using `rollapply()` with another special function. Very well done, but complicated.


{% highlight r %}
# A function that calculates the rolling correlation between a sector ETF and the SPY SP500 ETF. 
sector_index_correlation <- function(x, window) {
    # Make one xts object to hold the sector returns and the SPY returns  
    merged_xts <- merge(x, etf_returns_rviews$'Index')

    # Use rollapply() to calculate the rolling correlations. 
    # See what happens if you remove the 'pairwise.complete.obs' argument - the NAs will cause problems.
    merged_xts$rolling_cor <- rollapply(merged_xts, window, 
                                         function(x) cor(x[,1], x[,2], use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), 
                                         by.column = FALSE)
    
    names(merged_xts) <- c("Sector Returns", "SPY Returns", "Sector/SPY Correlation")
    
    merged_xts
}
{% endhighlight %}

##### Step 2: Apply the function to the data

_RViews_ applies the special function across the "Information Technology" ETF only. Again, `purrr` is needed to map across all ETF's if desired, which is an additional step.


{% highlight r %}
# Choose a sector ETF and a rolling window and pass them to the function we just build. 
# Let's go with a 5 month window and the Information Technology sector.
# We will now have a new xts object with 3 time series: sector returns, SPY returns
# and the rolling correlation between those return series.

IT_SPY_correlation <- sector_index_correlation(etf_returns_rviews$'Information Technology', 20)

# Have a peek. The first 20 rows in the correlation column should be 
# NAs. 

head(IT_SPY_correlation, n = 25)
{% endhighlight %}

## BizSci

And, here's how we solved it using `tidyquant`.

##### Step 1: Merge SPY ETF Weekly Returns with Sector ETF Weekly Returns

First, we add the weekly returns for the "SPY" index (which is currently the last group in the tibble) as it's own column. This is what our correlations will be calculated against. To do this, we will have to isolate that "SPY" data, and merge it with the original data. The easiest way is to `filter()` the "SPY" weekly returns and then join (`inner_join()`) as a new column using `by = "date"` as the merge key. 


{% highlight r %}
# Isolate SPY
index <- etf_returns_bizsci %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    filter(ticker == "SPY") %>% 
    select(date, weekly.returns) %>%
    rename(index.returns = weekly.returns)

# Join on date
etf_returns_bizsci_joined <- inner_join(etf_returns_bizsci, index, by = "date")

head(etf_returns_bizsci_joined)
{% endhighlight %}

{% endhighlight %}


##### Step 2: Use tq_mutate_xy() to apply runCor()

Now what? _RViews_ used the more generic `rollapply()` function, and then created the function for correlations. While this is definitely possible using `tq_mutate`, it's easier to just use the `runCor()` function from the `TTR` package through `tq_mutate_xy()` instead. If you are new to `tidyquant`, the mutate functions will do exactly what we need:

  * `tq_mutate()` aggregates the functions from `quantmod`, `xts`, `zoo`, and `TTR` using OHLCV style data and notation. It accepts `ohlc_fun` and `mutate_fun` to apply a function to OHLCV inputs. We don't use this version because it can't accept non-OHLC data or apply functions that require two primary arguments.

  * `tq_mutate_xy()` works with functions from `quantmod`, `xts`, `zoo`, and `TTR` packages that require two arguments (x and y). It's also used when you have data that is not in OHLCV format. Here, we face both situations. It accepts `x`, `y`, and `mutate_fun` args, which handles our situation perfectly!

The usage of `runCor` by itself looks like: `runCor(x, y, n = 10)` so we will use `tq_mutate_xy()` to pass in the `x` and `y` arguments, and then pass through `n = 20` using the `...`. As an aside, you may be wondering what the `col_rename` argument is. Simply put it renames the mutation output, which is surprisingly handy by eliminating one extra line of code.


{% highlight r %}
# Get running correlations
etf_returns_runCor_bizsci <- etf_returns_bizsci_joined %>% 
    tq_mutate_xy(x = weekly.returns, y = index.returns,  
                 mutate_fun = runCor, n = 20, col_rename = "cor")
                                                    
# Isolate Information Technology, and get past the NA's for our viewing pleasure
etf_returns_runCor_bizsci %>%
    filter(sector == "Information Technology") %>%
    slice(20:n())
{% endhighlight %}

__There's an added bonus...__

As opposed to the _RViews_ function, __we actually calculated the rolling correlations for _all_ of the ETF groups__ in the tibble, not just the one that you pass in! This is typically desired because the user is usually interested in understanding how all groups within a data set correlate to a baseline as opposed to just one.

# Dygraph

Finally, let's recreate the [Dygraph](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) for the "Information Technology" sector. Dygraphs take an xts object as input, which is NOT the format we are in currently (we are in tibble format). The most useful function here is `as_xts()`, a `tidyquant` function that provides an easy way to convert from tibbles to xts. Selecting just the "date" and "cor" columns from the input and specifying the `date_col = date` in `as_xts()` allows us to use the same code as _RViews_ to create the Dygraph.



{% highlight r %}
etf_returns_runCor_bizsci %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    filter(sector == "Information Technology") %>% 
    select(date, cor) %>%
    as_xts(date_col = date) %>% 
    dygraph(main = "Correlation between SP500 and Tech ETF") %>% 
        dyAxis("y", label = "Correlation") %>% 
        dyRangeSelector(height = 20) %>%
        # Add shading for the recessionary period
        dyShading(from = "2007-12-01", to = "2009-06-01", color = "#FFE6E6") %>% 
        # Add an event for the financial crisis. 
        dyEvent(x = "2008-09-15", label = "Fin Crisis", labelLoc = "top", color = "red")
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it! Hopefully you have seen that `tidyquant` is a great way to streamline and even scale your financial analysis workflow. And, we have only scratched the surface of what it can do! You can check out the stable release of `tidyquant` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/index.html), and the development release from [Github](https://github.com/mdancho84/tidyquant). Stay tuned for more to come!
