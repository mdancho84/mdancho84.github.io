The [R/Finance 2017](http://www.rinfinance.com/) conference was just held at the UIC in Chicago, and the event was a huge success. There were a ton of high quality presentations really showcasing innovation in finance. We gave a presentation on `tidyquant` illustrating the key benefits related to financial analysis in the tidyverse. We've uploaded the [tidyquant presentation to YouTube](https://youtu.be/yIbgf9zasaY?list=PLo32uKohmrXtepF9JgZlA5uNt7CP-SF5k). Check out the presentation.
