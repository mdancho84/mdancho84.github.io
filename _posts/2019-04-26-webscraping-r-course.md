First, you start off with the ___Business Case___...

## Business Case - Analyzing Competitor Products is a Competitive Advantage

The first question we need to ask ourself is, "Why web-scrape?".

__Answer:__

<p class="text-center" style="font-size:36px;color:blue;">Web-Scraping is a Competitive Advantage.</p>

The web is full of __free and valuable data__. ___Many companies___ put their product information out there to attract customers and sell products. ___Few companies___ implement programs to actively retrieve and analyze __competitor data__. Companies that implement web-scraping programs have a <mark>Competitive Advantage</mark> over those that don't. 

Here's an example of [__Cannondale Bicycles__](https://www.cannondale.com/en/USA/) (Matt's favorite bike manufacturer!).

![Cannondale Bicycles Product Pages](/assets/2019-04-26-web-scraping-course/product_pages.jpg)
<p class="date text-center">Product Data - Free and Valuable Information</p>

Every manufacturer in the _"High-End Bicycle Space"_ has product pages like these that can be webscraped.

__Guess what?__

In this [___Learning Labs "1-Hour Course"___](https://university.business-science.io/p/learning-labs-pro/?coupon_code=LLPROLAUNCH), you learn ___how to web-scrape 248 bicycles from Cannondale to put into a strategic database with competitor product data___ that looks like this.
