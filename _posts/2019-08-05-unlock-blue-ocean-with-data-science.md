Blue Ocean Strategy is a groundbreaking methodology for creating uncontested market space and making competition irrelevant. It's core to developing profitable new products and services. Over my 10+ year career designing software and implementing data science in organizations, I've built my own Blue Ocean organization, [_Business Science_](https://www.business-science.io/), and I've helped hundreds of students become data scientists in their organizations, __unlocking the ability to create new products and services with data for their organizations__. In this article, we'll examine how Blue Oceans are created and how your organization can create Blue Oceans with Data Science too. We'll finish with a _roadmap_ for your organization to ___build Blue Oceans with Data Science___. 

## Blue Ocean Strategy - The Book

<a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/" target="_blank"><img class="img-rounded pull-right" style="width:30%;" src="/assets/2019-08-05-blue-ocean/blue_ocean_strategy_book.jpg"></a>

_"Help! My Ocean is Turning Red"_ is how the most recent edition of the international best selling book on corporate strategy, [_"Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant"_](https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/), begins. For those unfamiliar, the ___Red Ocean___ is what happens when markets become competitive and leaders find themselves fighting in an ocean of bloody competition. Margins shrink as competition intensifies driving commoditization. 

Conversely, the ___Blue Ocean___ is where we want to be. The Blue Ocean is a metaphor for endless possibility that has borne new markets and products that have largely driven our economic history, not to mention economic prosperity for the organizations that have risen to the challenge. The challenge is creating Blue Oceans. 

One of the lessons I've learned over my 10+ year career in applying data science, machine learning, and web technology to business is that we can use ___Data Science___ to create Blue Oceans. 

In fact, it's not just Data Science, but rather it's the ability to provide new product offerings that transport us from Red Oceans to Blue Oceans. As I will demonstrate, Data Science is an untapped technology that can be used to unlock Blue Oceans for your organization. 

## How Blue Oceans Are Created

Before I jump into data science, let's first examine what a Blue Ocean is and how it's created with the Four Actions Framework. 

### Red Oceans vs Blue Oceans

![Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean](/assets/2019-08-05-blue-ocean/red_ocean_vs_blue_ocean.jpg)

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/tools/red-ocean-vs-blue-ocean-strategy/" target="_blank">Source: Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean Strategy</a></p>

Most of corporate strategy is concerned with Red Ocean Strategy. It's what's taught in almost every MBA program. Porter's Five Forces, SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats). This is Red Ocean Strategy. It's marked by an intense focus on what the competition is doing.

Blue Ocean Strategy is different - The focus is unlocking uncontested market spaces where competition is irrelevant. It's marked by an intense focus is on capturing new demand from the customer by offering a product or service that is a "quantum leap in value".

### The Four Actions Framework

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/tools/four-actions-framework/" target="_blank">Source: Four Actions Framework</a></p>

Every Market contains the status quo. What all firms in the space compete on. The [Four Actions Framework](https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/tools/four-actions-framework/) contains the 4 actions that firms take to create a Blue Ocean from an existing market.  

1. ___Raise___ - Features that exist in the status quo that should be raised well above the standard.

2. ___Create___ - New features that should be created that the industry has never offered.

3. ___Reduce___ - Features that the industry has traditionally offered that should be reduced well below the industry standard.

4. ___Eliminate___ - Features that the industry has long competed on but should be eliminated.

All Blue Oceans are created from strategic implementation of four actions. 

## Using Data Science to Unlock Blue Oceans

Unlocking Blue Oceans is easier said than done, but what if it could be done with a new tool termed ___Data Science___. In this section, I'll first define what Data Science is and then I'll give you two examples of how Data Science can be used to create new products that customers will crave opening up new markets in the process.

### Data Science 

First, what is Data Science? Much has been made of 3 terms: Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Machine Learning. Most have heard of these terms, but few truly understand what they can be used for.

![Data Science Insights and Web Technology](/assets/2019-08-05-blue-ocean/data_science_insights_and_web_technology.jpg)
<p class="text-center date">Data Science Insights and Web Technology Combine to Generate Blue Ocean Opportunity</p>

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://www.business-science.io/" target="_blank">Source: Business Science</a></p>


Rather than go into the details, I'm going to cut to the chase. Data Science has two attributes that can help create Blue Oceans:

1. ___Data Science Insights___ - The ability to use algorithms and data to generate predictive insights.

2. ___Web Technology___ - The ability to distribute these insights at scale without users needing knowledge of data science. 

When combined these two attributes create new products that customers have never experienced before. This is the exact environment needed to unlock Blue Oceans.

### Unlocking a Blue Ocean in Investment Management Services

In this section, we'll take a look at a market: __Investment Management Services__, showing how we can use data science to develop an investment product that appeals to changing customer preferences while opening up a new market for automated portfolio risk mitigation.

<p class="text-center date"><a href="https://business-science.shinyapps.io/stock_optimization_app/" target="_blank">Stock Portfolio Optimization Application (Click to Try the App)</a></p>




#### Market Outlook: Investment Management Services

According to [Deloitte's Investment Management Outlook](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/investment-management-industry-outlook.html), ___Investment Management Services___ is in a period of rapid change, driven by shifting investor preferences, margin compression, regulatory developments, and advancing technologies. 

- ___Increased Competition___ - Tech-savvy firms are putting pressure on traditional firms; these new entrants are likely to provide low-cost services, coupled with digital-age capabilities.

- ___Changing Customer Preferences___ - They tend to prefer engaging with online and mobile channels, a low minimum initial investment amount, and 24/7 access to investment advice on smart devices.

It's the perfect opportunity for a Blue Ocean - Creating a completely new model for investment management. 

#### Creating A Blue Ocean Product

What if you could build an application that gives customers better control over their investment portfolio while limiting investment risk at the same time? A product that let the customers pick the stocks, implementing __data science algorithms__ to optimize their portfolios for both high returns and low risk. It would be a shift from the traditional way of investing with pre-determined stock portfolios, but according to Deloitte, that's exactly what new investors want. __More control, more technology, 24/7.__

Here's the new product that you and your team develops. It's a ___Portfolio Optimization Application___. It enables your customers to select 3 stocks they want in their portfolio.

![Pick 3 Stocks](/assets/2019-08-05-blue-ocean/pick_3_stocks.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">The customer selects their favorite stocks</p>


The application then automatically balances the portfolio for your investors to minimize risk (and bad decisions). For example, the portfolio allocation for an investor wanting AAPL, GOOG, and NFLX would result in: ___49% AAPL, 30.1% GOOG, and 20.8% NFLX.___

![Automatic Portfolio Balancing](/assets/2019-08-05-blue-ocean/automatic_portfolio_balancing.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">Your product implements automatic portfolio optimization using your proprietary data science algorithm</p>


Say the customer did something silly like try to include GE in their stock mix. The application would automatically de-weight GE to prevent the investor from absorbing significant losses. ___75.7% AAPL, 3.5% GE, and 20.7% NFLX.___

![GE gets De-Weighted](/assets/2019-08-05-blue-ocean/ge_deweighted.jpg)

<p class="text-center date">The proprietary algorithm prevents bad decisions from costing your customer money</p>

#### Applying the Four Actions Framework

The Blue Ocean Strategy needs more than a good idea. Let's apply the Four Actions Framework to identify the value offering. 

1. __Raise__ - Give investors more flexibility by allowing them to pick stocks instead of investing in pre-built investment products.

2. __Create__ - Give them access to data science algorithms that optimize the stock allocation to minimize risk.

3. __Reduce__ - Reduce reliance on active management.

4. __Eliminate__ - Overhead of managing multiple portfolio products. 

The customer gets an easy-to-use product that they control 24/7 with less complex decisions like PE Ratios, Fee Assessments, Prospectus, etc. The cost-structure is lower with less reliance on active management and maintaining multiple product lines. The customer benefits
