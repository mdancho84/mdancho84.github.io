# My dirty little secret... How I 2x-ed my salary in 3 years using Time Series Analysis

It was 2015. I was working for a manufacturer that supplied products for Oil and Gas. The company was struggling. The price of oil had dropped from $100 to $30 leading to the worst performance in over 2 decades.


![Oil Price and Product Sales](/assets/075_price_of_oil.jpg)

I was working on a project to forecast product sales when I stumbled upon something. I found that the sales for certain products were highly correlated with the 3-month lag of the price of oil.

With this information, I was able to forecast sales for the next 3 months with 95% accuracy. This was a game-changer for the company. We were able to forecast sales and adjust production to meet demand.

**Impact on my career:** This led to 3 promotions in 3 years. I went from a Manager of Sales to the Director of Sales and Engineering leading 60+ person sales team when I left in 2018. But I had a secret...

**My dirty little secret:** Behind the scenes I was using R and time series analysis to get ahead in my career. Specifically, I used autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation to find the signal. The same techniques that you're learning today.


# What is Time Series Analysis?

Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time-ordered data points. It's commonly used to analyze and interpret trends, patterns, and relationships within data that is recorded over time (e.g. with timestamps). 

## Uses in Business

Understanding and applying time series analysis concepts is critical for **forecasting, detecting anomalies, and drawing insights on data that varies over time.** 

**Time series data is everywhere.** Anything with a timestamp is a time series. Product sales, website traffic, stock prices, and weather data are all examples of time series data. It is used in many industries including finance, retail, marketing, and manufacturing.

**Time Series Analysis is important because it allows us to understand the past and predict the future.** Time series analysis is used to understand the past and predict the future. It is used in many industries including finance, retail, marketing, and manufacturing.



# The 5 Concepts that Helped Me the Most in My Career (and how to do them in `R`)

<p class="date text-center">The 5 Concepts that helped me the most</p>

## R Code

**Get The Code:** You can follow along with the R code in the [R-Tips Newsletter](https://learn.business-science.io/r-tips-newsletter?el=website). **All code is avaliable in R-Tip 075.**


## 1. Visualizing Time Series Data

Visualizing time series is the start of all of my time series analysis. This is the first step in understanding the data.

![Time Series Visualizations](/assets/075_time_series_visualization.jpg)

#### `R` code to make this plot:

The main functions come from `timetk`. Full disclosure- I'm the author of `timetk`. I created `timetk` to make time series analysis easier.

## Time Series is Noisy (Finding the Signal)

Often, time series data is noisy. We can use smoothing to find the signal. LOESS smoothing is a technique that uses local regression to smooth out the noise.

![Time Series Smoothing](/assets/075_time_series_plot_smoother.jpg)

#### `R` code to make Visualization 2:

It's the same function, but now we turn `.smooth = TRUE`. You can adjust the value of the smoother span to get different results.

## 3. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation

![Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation](/assets/075_autocorrelation.jpg)

**Autocorrelation:** This refers to the correlation of a time series with its own past and future values. It measures the relationship (correlation) between a variable's current value and its past values. 

**Partial Autocorrelation:** Autocorrelation has a problem. Some of the correlation is confounded by earlier lags. Enter Partial Autocorrelation. This removes the correlation effect of earlier lags. We can see that Lag 1 and 6 are the most important for this time series. 

#### `R` Code to make this plot:

## 4. Seasonal Decomposition

![Seasonal Decomposition](/assets/075_seasonal_decomposition.jpg)

Seasonal decomposition decomposes a time series into three components: **trend, seasonal, and residual (irregular)**. STL stands for Seasonal-Trend-Loess.

 **It uses a "LOESS" smoother** to remove seasonal and trend effects. STL is flexible and can handle any type of seasonality, not just fixed seasonal effects. 
 
 **The residuals** can be analyzed for outliers since they have been de-trended and de-seasonalized.

#### `R` Code to make this plot:

## 5. Calendar Effects

![Calendar Effects](/assets/075_calendar_effects.jpg)


Calendar effects refer to variations in a time series that can be attributed to the calendar itself. This can include effects due to day of the week, month of the year, or holidays tied to the calendar.

# Conclusions:

You've learned the 5 concepts that helped me the most in my career. And the best part is that you can do all of this in 5 lines of R code.

Here's another little secret, I teach these concepts plus others in just Module 1 of 18 in my [High-Performance Time Series Course](https://university.business-science.io/p/ds4b-203-r-high-performance-time-series-forecasting?el=website).
