### Time Series is Changing

Time series is changing. **Businesses now need 10,000+ time series
forecasts every day.** This is what I call a *High-Performance Time
Series Forecasting System (HPTSF)* - Accurate, Robust, and Scalable
Forecasting.

**High-Performance Forecasting Systems will save companies by improving
accuracy and scalability.** Imagine what will happen to your career if
you can provide your organization a “High-Performance Time Series
Forecasting System” (HPTSF System).
