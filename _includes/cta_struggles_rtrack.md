# My Struggles with Learning Data Science

It took me a long time to learn how to apply data science to business. And I made a lot of mistakes as I fumbled through learning R.

I specifically had a tough time navigating the ever-increasing landscape of tools and packages, trying to pick between R and Python, and getting lost along the way.

**If you feel like this, you're not alone.**

In fact, that's the driving reason that I created Business Science and Business Science University ([You can read about my personal journey here](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/07/22/how-i-started-my-data-science-business.html)).

What I found out is that:

1. **Data Science does not have to be difficult, it just has to be taught from a business perspective**
2. **Anyone can learn data science fast provided they are motivated.**

# How I can help

If you are interested in learning R and the ecosystem of tools at a deeper level, then I have a streamlined program that will **get you past your struggles** and improve your career in the process.

It's my [5-Course R-Track System](https://university.business-science.io/p/5-course-bundle-machine-learning-web-apps-time-series/). It's an integrated system containing 5 courses that work together on a learning path. Through 8 projects, you learn everything you need to help your organization: from data science foundations, to advanced machine learning, to web applications and deployment.

The result is that **you break through previous struggles**, learning from my experience & our community of 2653 data scientists that are ready to help you succeed.
